It provides thoroughly tested Istio versions compatible with all major cloud platforms. Derived from the open-source Tetrate Istio Distro project, TIS adds extensive support to these builds, including optional FIPS-validated cryptographic modules and a range of tested add-ons and integrations.\n\n## Why Choose TIS?\n\nTIS is not a fork but an upstream distribution of Istio tailored for specific environments. Enhancements made to Istio are integrated upstream. Key benefits of TIS include:\n\n1. **Extended Support**: TIS offers 14 months of security update support.\n2. **Commercial Support**: TIS provides business support options for enterprise use cases, including compliance needs.\n3. **Ease of Management**: TIS simplifies installation and management processes.\n4. **Multi-Environment Adaptability**: TIS supports various cloud environments.\n5. **FIPS Validation**: TIS offers FIPS-validated versions for high-security requirements.\n\n[Visit the TIS docs for more information ›](https:\/\/docs.tetrate.io\/istio-subscription\/)\n\n## Pre-Installation Requirements\n\nBefore installing TIS and its plugins, you’ll need:\n\n- [Terraform](https:\/\/www.terraform.io\/) for importing dashboards into Grafana.\n- Credentials from Tetrate for installing TIS.\n  - tis_username\n  - tis_password\n\n## Installing Istio and Monitoring Addons\n\nFirst, check the supported Istio versions with TIS:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\nhelm search repo tetratelabs\/base --versions\nNAME            CHART VERSION  APP VERSION    DESCRIPTION\ntetratelabs\/base1.20.1\u002btetrate01.20.1-tetrate0Helm chart for deploying Istio cluster resource...\ntetratelabs\/base1.20.0\u002btetrate01.20.0-tetrate0Helm chart for deploying Istio cluster resource...\ntetratelabs\/base1.19.5\u002btetrate01.19.5-tetrate0Helm chart for deploying Istio cluster resource...\ntetratelabs\/base1.19.4\u002btetrate01.19.4-tetrate0Helm chart for deploying Istio cluster resource...\ntetratelabs\/base1.19.3\u002btetrate01.19.3-tetrate0Helm chart for deploying Istio cluster resource...\ntetratelabs\/base1.18.6\u002btetrate01.18.6-tetrate0Helm chart for deploying Istio cluster resource...\ntetratelabs\/base1.18.5\u002btetrate01.18.5-tetrate0Helm chart for deploying Istio cluster resource...\ntetratelabs\/base1.18.3\u002btetrate01.18.3-tetrate0Helm chart for deploying Istio cluster resource...\ntetratelabs\/base1.17.8\u002btetrate01.17.8-tetrate0Helm chart for deploying Istio cluster resource...\ntetratelabs\/base1.17.6\u002btetrate01.17.6-tetrate0Helm chart for deploying Istio cluster resource...\ntetratelabs\/base1.16.7\u002btetrate01.16.7-tetrate0Helm chart for deploying Istio cluster resource...\ntetratelabs\/base1.16.6\u002btetrate01.16.6-tetrate0Helm chart for deploying Istio cluster resource...\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nWe’ll install the latest Istio version, 1.20.1.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nexport TIS_USER=\u0022\u003ctis_username\u003e\u0022\nexport TIS_PASS=\u0022\u003ctis_password\u003e\u0022\n# Helm chart version\nexport VERSION=1.20.1\u002btetrate0\n# Image tag\nexport TAG=1.20.1-tetrate0\nkubectl create namespace istio-system\n\nkubectl create secret docker-registry tetrate-tis-creds \\\n    --docker-server=\u0022addon-containers.istio.tetratelabs.com\u0022 \\\n    --docker-username=${TIS_USER} \\\n    --docker-password=${TIS_PASS} \\\n    -n istio-system\n\n# Install Istio\nhelm install istio-base tetratelabs\/base -n istio-system \\\n    --set global.tag=${TAG} \\\n    --set global.hub=\u0022addon-containers.istio.tetratelabs.com\u0022 \\\n    --set \u0022global.imagePullSecrets[0]=tetrate-tis-creds\u0022 \\\n    --version ${VERSION}\n\nhelm install istiod tetratelabs\/istiod -n istio-system \\\n    --set global.tag=${TAG} \\\n    --set global.hub=\u0022addon-containers.istio.tetratelabs.com\u0022 \\\n    --set \u0022global.imagePullSecrets[0]=tetrate-tis-creds\u0022 \\\n    --version ${VERSION} \\\n    --wait\n\n# install ingress Gateway\nkubectl create namespace istio-ingress\n\nkubectl create secret docker-registry tetrate-tis-creds \\\n    --docker-server=\u0022addon-containers.istio.tetratelabs.com\u0022 \\\n    --docker-username=${TIS_USER} \\\n    --docker-password=${TIS_PASS} \\\n    -n istio-ingress\n\nhelm install istio-ingress tetratelabs\/istio-ingress -n istio-ingress \\\n    --set global.tag=${TAG} \\\n    --set global.hub=\u0022addon-containers.istio.tetratelabs.com\u0022 \\\n    --set \u0022global.imagePullSecrets[0]=tetrate-tis-creds\u0022 \\\n    --version ${VERSION} \\\n    --wait\n\n# Install TIS addon\nhelm install istio-monitoring-demo tis-addons\/istio-monitoring-demo --namespace tis --create-namespace\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nPort forward the Grafana service and open it in your local browser: [http:\/\/localhost:3000](http:\/\/localhost:3000\/):\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl port-forward --namespace tis svc\/grafana 3000:3000\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nNote: Keep the port-forwarding command running, as we’ll need access to this port for importing the dashboard into Grafana.\n\n## Why TIS Monitoring Addon?\n\nThe Tetrate Istio Subscription (TIS) Monitoring Addon stands out by offering a tailored and advanced monitoring experience compared to standard Istio dashboards. It focuses on modern needs with four specialized dashboards, replacing outdated elements with relevant metrics. Key enhancements include a unified panel design, detailed service insights, and critical metrics like sidecar performance. Reserved for TIS customers, these dashboards reflect Tetrate’s commitment to providing value beyond basic support, ensuring a personalized and evolving monitoring solution. Choosing TIS Monitoring Addon means accessing a service that not only meets current needs but also adapts to future demands.\n\n## Installing Istio Monitoring Addons\n\nAfter logging in with the default user name and password admin\/admin, select Administration-Service accounts in the left navigation bar, and follow the instructions in the Grafana documentation to create a Service account with admin privilege.\n\n![Grafana Service Account](grafana-service-account.jpg)\n\nCreate a Service account for Grafana then use Terraform to import dashboards into Grafana:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\ncat\u003e~\/.terraformrc\u003c\u003cEOF\ncredentials \u0022terraform.cloudsmith.io\u0022 {\n  token = \u0022tetrate\/tis-containers\/\u003ctis_password\u003e\u0022\n}\nEOF\n\n# Create a terraform module file\ncat\u003eistio-monitoring-grafana.tf\u003c\u003cEOF\nmodule \u0022istio_monitoring_grafana\u0022 {\n  source = \u0022terraform.cloudsmith.io\/tis-containers\/istio-monitoring-grafana\/tetrate\u0022\n  version = \u0022v0.2.0\u0022\n  gf_url  = \u0022http:\/\/localhost:3000\u0022\n  gf_auth = \u0022\u003cgrafana_service_account_token\u003e\u0022\n}\nEOF\n\n# Run the commands\nterraform init\nterraform plan\nterraform apply -auto-approve\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nCongratulations, you have successfully imported four dashboards into Grafana:\n\n- Istio Workload Dashboard\n- Istio Service Dashboard\n- Istio Wasm Extension Dashboard\n- Istio Control Plan Dashboard\n\nHowever, some dashboards might not have data yet. Let’s generate some traffic in the mesh.\n\n## Testing the Monitoring\n\nDeploy the Bookinfo application and [ingress gateway](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/learn\/kubernetes\/what-is-kubernetes-ingress\/):\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl create secret docker-registry tetrate-tis-creds \\\n    --docker-server=\u0022addon-containers.istio.tetratelabs.com\u0022 \\\n    --docker-username=${TIS_USER} \\\n    --docker-password=${TIS_PASS} \\\n    -n default\nkubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled\nkubectl apply -f https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/istio\/istio\/release-1.20\/samples\/bookinfo\/platform\/kube\/bookinfo.yaml -n default\nkubectl apply -f https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/istio\/istio\/release-1.20\/samples\/bookinfo\/platform\/kube\/bookinfo-gateway.yaml -n default\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nRetrieve the ingress gateway IP and generate traffic:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nexport GATEWAY_IP=$(kubectl -n istio-ingress get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath=\u0027{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}\u0027)\nfor i in $(seq 1 100);do curl http:\/\/$GATEWAY_IP\/productpage ; sleep 3;done\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nNow, when you visit the Grafana dashboard, you will see monitoring data.\n\n![Grafana Dashboard](istio-workload-dashboard.jpg)\n\nIn addition, while importing these dashboards, we also imported the following alert rules:\n\n![Altering Rules](alerting-rules.jpg)\n\nYou can also define alert rules in Grafana, such as [integrating Telegram](https:\/\/grafana.com\/blog\/2023\/12\/28\/how-to-integrate-grafana-alerting-and-telegram\/) and Slack to send notifications.\n\n## Cleanup\n\nRun the following command to clean up the Bookinfo app and TIS:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl delete -f samples\/bookinfo\/platform\/kube\/bookinfo.yaml\nkubectl delete -f samples\/bookinfo\/networking\/bookinfo-gateway.yaml\nhelm uninstall istio-ingress -n istio-ingress\nhelm uninstall istio-monitoring-demo -n tis\nhelm uninstall istiod -n istio-system\nhelm uninstall istio-base -n istio-system\nkubectl delete namespace tis\nkubectl delete namespace istio-ingress\nkubectl delete namespace istio-system\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps, you have successfully set up and tested monitoring in Istio using TIS.

This blog will provide an overview of the updates bundled in this release.\n\n## Gateway API: Revolutionizing Service Mesh\n\nOur[ previous blog](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/why-the-gateway-api-is-the-unified-future-of-ingress-for-kubernetes-and-service-mesh\/) highlighted the Gateway API’s potential to harmonize ingress gateways in Kubernetes and service mesh, opening doors to cross-namespace traffic support. With Istio’s official endorsement, the Gateway API takes center stage. While traditionally applied to north-south traffic (the ingress and egress of the mesh), it now extends its prowess to the realm of east-west traffic, the lifeblood within the mesh.\n\nIn Kubernetes, services wear multiple hats, handling tasks from service discovery and DNS to workload selection, routing and load balancing. Yet, control over these functions has been limited, with workload selection being the notable exception. The Gateway API changes the game, putting you in command of service routing. This introduces some overlap with Istio’s VirtualService, as both wield influence over traffic routing. Here’s a glimpse into three scenarios:\n\n1. **Internal Kubernetes Requests:** Without Istio, all internal traffic in Kubernetes takes the service route.\n2. **North-South Traffic:** By applying the Gateway API to the Ingress gateway, incoming traffic to Kubernetes follows xRoute (currently supporting HTTPRoute, TCPRoute and gRPCRoute) to services.\n3. **East-West Traffic:** Inside Istio, as traffic enters the data plane, xRoute of the Gateway API takes charge. It guides the traffic to either the original or a new destination service.\n\n![Figure 1: Traffic routing.](gateway-api-request.svg)\n\nThis dynamic fusion of the Gateway API with Istio not only refines service networking but also solidifies Istio’s significance in the Kubernetes ecosystem.\n\n## Gateway API for Service Mesh: A Deeper Dive\n\nAt its current experimental stage (as of v0.8.0), the Gateway API for Service Mesh introduces a fresh approach to configuring service mesh support in Kubernetes. It directly links individual route resources (such as HTTPRoute) with Service resources, streamlining the configuration process.\n\nHere are some key takeaways:\n\n**Experimental Stage:** As of version v0.8.0, the Gateway API for Service Mesh is still experimental. It’s advised not to use it in production environments.\n\n**Service and Route Association:** Unlike using Gateway and GatewayClass resources, individual route resources are linked directly with Service resources when configuring a service mesh.\n\n**Frontend and Backend Aspects of Service:** The Service’s frontend encompasses its name and cluster IP, while the backend consists of its collection of endpoint IPs. This distinction facilitates routing within a mesh without introducing redundant resources.\n\n**Route Attachment to Service:** Routes are attached to a Service to apply configuration to any traffic directed to that Service. The traffic follows the mesh’s default behavior if no Routes are attached.\n\n**Namespace Relationships**:\n\n- *Same Namespace:* A Route in the same Namespace as its Service, known as a producer route, is typically created by the workload creator to define acceptable usage. It affects all requests from any client of the workload across any Namespace.\n- *Different Namespaces:* A Route in a different Namespace than its Service, termed a consumer route, refines how a consumer of a given workload makes requests. This Route only influences requests from workloads in the same Namespace as the Route.\n\n![Figure 2: Producer Route and Consumer Route.](gateway-api-reference.svg)\n\n**Combining Routes:** Multiple Routes for the same Service in a single Namespace, whether producer or consumer routes, will be merged according to the Gateway API Route merging rules. This means defining distinct consumer routes for multiple consumers in the same Namespace is impossible.\n\n**Request Flow**:\n\n- A client workload initiates a request for a specific Service in a Namespace.\n- The mesh data plane intercepts the request and identifies the target Service.\n- Based on associated Routes, the request is allowed, rejected, or forwarded to the appropriate workload based on matching rules.\n\nBear in mind that, in the experimental stage, the Gateway API for Service Mesh may undergo further changes and is not recommended for production use.\n\nBut wait, there’s more! Our journey doesn’t end here – the support for ingress traffic using the API is rapidly heading toward General Availability, promising even more dynamic developments!\n\nLet’s delve further into additional enhancements in this release.\n\n## Ambient Mesh Enhancements\n\nThe Istio team has been tirelessly refining the ambient mesh, an innovative deployment model that offers an alternative to the traditional sidecar approach. If you haven’t explored ambient yet, now’s the perfect time to dive into the[ introduction blog post](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2022\/introducing-ambient-mesh\/).\n\nWith this update, we’ve amplified support for \u0060ServiceEntry\u0060, \u0060WorkloadEntry\u0060, \u0060PeerAuthentication\u0060 and DNS proxying. Alongside, bug fixes and reliability enhancements ensure a seamless experience.\n\nRemember, the ambient mesh is in its alpha phase for this release. The Istio community eagerly awaits your feedback to propel it toward Beta.\n\n## Simplified Virtual Machine and Multicluster Experiences\n\nSimplicity is key, especially when working with Virtual Machines and Multicluster setups. In this release, we’ve made the address field optional in the \u0060WorkloadEntry\u0060 resources. This seemingly small adjustment promises to streamline your workflow significantly.\n\n## Elevated Security Configurations\n\nYou can now configure \u0060OPTIONAL_MUTUAL\u0060 for your Istio ingress gateway’s TLS settings, providing the flexibility of optional client certificate validation. Additionally, you can fine-tune your preferred cipher suites used for non-Istio mTLS traffic via \u0060MeshConfig\u0060.\n\nWith these updates, Istio 1.19 empowers you with greater control, flexibility and security in managing your service mesh.\n\nFeel free to explore these enhancements and share your experiences with the Istio community. For more details, refer to the[ official release notes](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/news\/releases\/1.19.x\/announcing-1.19\/).\n\nHappy meshing!\n\n---\n\nThis blog was initially published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/whats-new-in-istio-1-19-gateway-api-and-beyond\/).\n', '\/en\/blog\/istio-119-release\/')">

              <a href="#" onclick="exportToMarkdown('Implementing GitOps and Canary Deployment with Argo Project and Istio', 'This article discusses how to use Deployment, ArgoCD, and Istio to implement GitOps and canary deployment. ', '\nThe development of cloud-native applications has led to a shift in development to the left and a higher frequency of application iteration, which has given rise to the need for GitOps. This article will introduce how to use the Argo project, including ArgoCD and Argo Rollouts, to achieve GitOps and canary deployment with Istio. There is also a demonstration in the article that shows how to achieve GitOps based on the Istio environment provided by Tetrate Service Express (also applicable to Tetrate Service Bridge).\n\nThe deployment architecture diagram of the demo in this article is shown in Figure 1. If you are already familiar with the deployment strategies and Argo projects introduced in this article, you can skip directly to the demo section.\n\n![Figure 1: Architecture diagram of using Istio and Argo projects in TSE\/TSB to achieve GitOps and canary release](f1.svg)\n\n## Deployment strategy\n\nFirst of all, I want to briefly introduce the two deployment strategies supported by Argo Rollouts, which can achieve zero-downtime deployment.\n\nThe steps of blue-green deployment and canary deployment are shown in Figure 2.\n\n![Figure 2: Steps of blue-green deployment and canary deployment](f2.svg)\n\n- Blue-green deployment is a strategy that deploys the new version of the application in a separate environment in parallel without affecting the current production environment. In blue-green deployment, the current production environment is called the \u0022blue environment,\u0022 and the environment where the new version of the application is deployed is called the \u0022green environment.\u0022 Once the green environment is considered stable and has passed the test, the traffic will gradually switch from the blue environment to the green environment, allowing users to gradually access the new version. If problems occur during the switching process, it can be quickly rolled back to the blue environment to minimize the impact on users. The advantage of blue-green deployment is that it can provide high availability and zero-downtime deployment.\n- Canary deployment is a strategy for gradually introducing new versions or features into the production environment. In canary deployment, the new version or feature is first deployed to a small number of users in the production environment, called \u0022canary users.\u0022 By monitoring the feedback and performance indicators of canary users, the development team can evaluate the stability and reliability of the new version or feature. If there are no problems, more users can be gradually included in the canary deployment until all users use the new version. If a problem is found, it can be quickly rolled back or fixed to avoid negative effects on the entire user group. The advantage of canary deployment is that it can quickly identify problems and make adjustments in a small impact area.\n\nThe main difference between blue-green deployment and canary deployment is the deployment method and the scale of the changes. Blue-green deployment deploys the entire application in a new environment and then switches, which is suitable for large-scale changes, such as major upgrades of the entire application. Canary deployment gradually introduces new versions or features, which is suitable for small-scale changes, such as adding or modifying a single feature.\n\nIn terms of application scenarios, blue-green deployment is suitable for systems with higher requirements for high availability and zero-downtime deployment. When deploying large-scale changes, blue-green deployment can ensure stability and reliability and can quickly roll back to cope with unexpected situations. Canary deployment is suitable for systems that need to quickly verify new features or versions. By gradually introducing changes, problems can be discovered early and adjustments can be made to minimize the impact on users.\n\n## Release strategy of Kubernetes Deployment\n\nIn Kubernetes, the Deployment resource object is one of the main tools for managing the deployment and updating of applications. Deployment provides a declarative way to define the expected state of an application and implements the release strategy through the controller\u0027s functionality. The architecture of Deployment is shown in Figure 3, where the colored squares represent pods of different versions.\n\n![Figure 3: Architecture diagram of Kubernetes Deployment](f3.svg)\n\nThe release strategy can be configured in the spec field of Deployment. Here are some common release policy options:\n\n1. **Management of ReplicaSet**: Deployment uses ReplicaSet to create and manage replicas of an application. The desired number of replicas can be specified by setting the \u0060spec.replicas\u0060 field. During the release process, the Kubernetes controller ensures that the number of replicas of the new version\u0027s ReplicaSet gradually increases when created, and the number of replicas of the old version\u0027s ReplicaSet gradually decreases when deleted to achieve a smooth switch.\n2. **Rolling update policy**: Deployment supports multiple rolling update policies, which can be selected by setting the \u0060spec.strategy.type\u0060 field. Common policies include:\n    - **RollingUpdate**: The default policy updates replicas gradually at a certain time interval. The number of replicas that are not available at the same time and the number of additional available replicas can be controlled by setting the \u0060spec.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable\u0060 and \u0060spec.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxSurge\u0060 fields.\n    - **Recreate**: This policy first deletes all replicas of the old version during the update process and then creates replicas of the new version. This policy will cause the application to be temporarily unavailable during the update.\n3. **Version control**: Deployment sets labels for each version\u0027s ReplicaSet through the \u0060spec.template.metadata.labels\u0060 field so that the controller can track and manage them accurately. This way, multiple versions of ReplicaSet can coexist, and the number of replicas of each version can be accurately controlled.\n\nBy using these configuration options, Deployment can achieve different release strategies. Updating the spec field of the Deployment object can trigger the release of a new version. The Kubernetes controller will automatically handle the creation, update, and deletion of replicas according to the specified policy to achieve smooth application updates and deployment strategies.\n\n## Implementing GitOps with ArgoCD\n\nYou can use Deployment to manually manage release strategies, but to achieve automation, we also need to use GitOps tools such as ArgoCD.\n\nArgoCD is a GitOps-based continuous delivery tool used to automate and manage the deployment of Kubernetes applications. It provides some key help to improve the efficiency and reliability of application deployment.\n\nHere are some of the help ArgoCD provides for Kubernetes application deployment:\n\n1. **Declarative configuration**: ArgoCD uses a declarative way to define the expected state of an application and stores the application configuration in a Git repository. By versioning and continuous integration\/continuous delivery (CI\/CD) processes, it is easy to track and manage application configuration changes.\n2. **Continuous deployment**: ArgoCD can monitor configuration changes in the Git repository and automatically deploy the application to the Kubernetes environment. It provides customizable synchronization policies that can automatically trigger application deployment and updates, achieving continuous deployment.\n3. **State comparison and automatic repair**: ArgoCD periodically checks the current state of the application and compares it with the expected state. If inconsistencies are found, it will automatically try to repair and restore the application to the desired state to ensure consistency between the expected and actual states.\n4. **Multi-environment management**: ArgoCD supports managing multiple Kubernetes environments, such as development, testing, and production environments. It is easy to deploy and synchronize application configurations between different environments, ensuring consistency and controllability.\n\nCompared to Deployment resource objects, ArgoCD provides more advanced features and workflows that complement the capabilities of native Kubernetes resource objects:\n\n**GitOps-based configuration management**: ArgoCD stores application configuration in a Git repository, enabling GitOps-based configuration management. This approach ensures that configuration changes are traceable, auditable, and can be integrated with existing CI\/CD pipelines.\n\n**Automated deployment and continuous delivery**: ArgoCD can automatically detect configuration changes in the Git repository and deploy applications to Kubernetes environments, enabling automated deployment and continuous delivery.\n\n**State management and automatic recovery**: ArgoCD continuously monitors the state of applications and compares it to the expected state. If inconsistencies are detected, it automatically recovers and ensures that the application state remains consistent with the expected state.\n\n## Using Istio to achieve fine-grained traffic routing\n\nAlthough ArgoCD can implement GitOps, it essentially operates on Kubernetes Deployment and controls traffic routing through replica numbers. To achieve fine-grained traffic routing, services meshes like Istio are used.\n\nIstio achieves finer-grained traffic routing and application release through the following methods:\n\n**VirtualService**: Istio uses VirtualService to define traffic routing rules. By configuring VirtualService, traffic can be routed and distributed based on request attributes such as request headers, paths, weights, etc., directing requests to different service instances or versions.\n\n**DestinationRule**: Istio\u0027s DestinationRule is used to define service version policies and load balancing settings. By specifying different traffic weights between service instances of different versions, advanced application release policies such as canary release or blue-green deployment can be implemented.\n\n**Traffic control and policies**: Istio provides rich traffic control and policy capabilities such as traffic limiting, fault injection, timeout settings, retry mechanisms, etc. These features help applications achieve higher-level load balancing, fault tolerance, and reliability requirements.\n\nCompared to ArgoCD and Kubernetes Deployment objects, Istio provides the following advantages in application deployment:\n\n**Fine-grained traffic routing control**: Istio provides richer traffic routing capabilities, enabling flexible routing and distribution based on a variety of request attributes, allowing for finer-grained traffic control and management.\n\n**Advanced release policy support**: Istio\u0027s DestinationRule can specify traffic weights between different versions of service instances, supporting advanced application release policies such as canary release and blue-green deployment. This makes version management and release of applications more flexible and controllable.\n\n**Powerful traffic control and policy capabilities**: Istio provides rich traffic control and policy capabilities such as traffic limiting, fault injection, timeout settings, retry mechanisms, etc. These features help applications achieve higher-level load balancing, fault tolerance, and reliability requirements.\n\nCombining Istio with Argo Rollouts can fully leverage the advantages of Istio\u0027s fine-grained traffic routing. Let\u0027s now have a demo together. In our demo, we will use the Kubernetes and Istio environments provided by TSE, implement GitOps using ArgoCD, and implement canary release using Argo Rollouts.\n\n## Demo\n\nThe software versions used in our demo are:\n\n- Kubernetes v1.24.14\n- Istio v1.15.7\n- ArgoCD v2.7.4\n- Argo Rollouts v1.5.1\n- TSE Preview2\n\nWe will use Istio\u0027s VirtualService and DestinationRule to implement traffic grouping routing based on Subset, and use ArgoCD Rollouts for progressive release.\n\n### Deploy ArgoCD and Argo Rollouts\n\nI have created a Kubernetes cluster and added it to TSE in advance, and TSE will automatically install Istio control plane for the cluster. We also need to install ArgoCD and Argo Rollouts:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\n# Install ArgoCD\nkubectl create namespace argocd\nkubectl apply -n argocd -f https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/argoproj\/argo-cd\/stable\/manifests\/install.yaml\n\n# Install ArgoCD CLI on macOS\nbrew install argocd\n\n# Change the service type of argocd-server to LoadBalancer\nkubectl patch svc argocd-server -n argocd -p \u0027{\u0022spec\u0022: {\u0022type\u0022: \u0022LoadBalancer\u0022}}\u0027\n\n# Get the ArgoCD UI address\nARGOCD_ADDR=$(kubectl get svc argocd-server -n argocd -o jsonpath=\u0027{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}\u0027)\n\n# Login using ArgoCD CLI, see https:\/\/argo-cd.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/getting_started\/#4-login-using-the-cli to get password\nargocd login $ARGOCD_ADDR --skip-test-tls --grpc-web --insecure\n\n# Install Argo Rollouts\nkubectl create namespace argo-rollouts\nkubectl apply -n argo-rollouts -f https:\/\/github.com\/argoproj\/argo-rollouts\/releases\/download\/latest\/install.yaml\n\n# Install rollouts plugin on macOS\ncurl -LO https:\/\/github.com\/argoproj\/argo-rollouts\/releases\/download\/v1.5.0\/kubectl-argo-rollouts-darwin-amd64\nchmod \u002bx .\/kubectl-argo-rollouts-darwin-amd64\nsudo mv .\/kubectl-argo-rollouts-darwin-amd64 \/usr\/local\/bin\/kubectl-argo-rollouts\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThis feature is not applicable to TSE Bridge Mode, so we will use TSE Direct Mode to achieve progressive release.\n\n{{\u003ccallout note \u0022💡 What is Bridge Mode and Direct Mode?\u0022\u003e}}\n\n\nDirect Mode and Bridge Mode are two modes in TSE for control plane to issue configuration. They are suitable for flow, security, and gateway group configuration modes. BRIDGED mode is a minimalist mode that allows users to quickly configure the most commonly used features in the service mesh using Tetrate-specific APIs, while DIRECT mode provides greater flexibility for advanced users, allowing them to configure using Istio APIs directly.\n\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\nNext, deploy Rollouts Dashboard:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\ngit clone https:\/\/github.com\/argoproj\/argo-rollouts.git\nkustomize build manifests\/dashboard-install|kubectl apply -n argo-rollouts -f -\nkubectl port-forward svc\/argo-rollouts-dashboard -n argo-rollouts 3100:3100\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nYou can now access the Rollouts Dashboard at [https:\/\/localhost:3100\/rollouts\/](https:\/\/localhost:3100\/rollouts\/).\n\n### Deploy Bookinfo Application\n\nWe have prepared the configuration file for the Bookinfo application (saved in the [tse-gitops-demo](https:\/\/github.com\/tetrateio\/tse-gitops-demo\/) repository), and you can also fork it to your own account and replace it with your own repository. Run the following command to deploy the Bookinfo application:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\nargocd app create bookinfo-app --repo https:\/\/github.com\/tetrateio\/tse-gitops-demo.git --path application --dest-server https:\/\/kubernetes.default.svc --dest-namespace bookinfo --sync-policy automated\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nNote: We set \u0060replicas\u0060 to \u00600\u0060 in the [\u0060reviews\u0060 Deployment](https:\/\/github.com\/tetrateio\/tse-gitops-demo\/blob\/main\/application\/bookinfo.yaml#L151) because we will create Argo Rollouts to manipulate the number of instances of the \u0060reviews\u0060 service. If you set it to a non-zero positive integer here, we will not be able to achieve canary deployment.\n\nNow you can open the ArgoCD UI in your browser, as shown in Figure 4.\n\n![Figure 4: ArgoCD UI](f4.png)\n\nIf you find that the application status is not in sync, you can run the following command or click the SYNC button in the UI.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nargocd app sync bookinfo-app\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## Implementing Fine-grained Traffic Management with Istio\n\nFirst, let\u0027s use Argo CD to create Istio-related resource objects:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nargocd app create bookinfo-tse-conf --repo https:\/\/github.com\/tetrateio\/tse-gitops-demo.git --path argo\/tse --dest-server https:\/\/kubernetes.default.svc --dest-namespace bookinfo --sync-policy automated --self-heal\n\n# Check the creation status\nargocd app get bookinfo-tse-conf\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n### Converting Deployment to Rollout\n\nSuppose we want to release a new version of the \u0060reviews\u0060 service. To achieve zero downtime updates, we will use canary deployment, with the following steps:\n\n1. Reduce the \u0060replicas\u0060 of the \u0060reviews\u0060 Deployment to 0;\n2. Create a Rollout that references the \u0060reviews\u0060 Deployment previously deployed in the Bookinfo application;\n3. Send traffic to the \u0060reviews\u0060 service to achieve automatic canary deployment progress.\n\nYou can view the Rollout and AnalysisTemplate configurations used in this demo on [GitHub](https:\/\/github.com\/tetrateio\/tse-gitops-demo\/tree\/main\/argo\/rollout). Run the following command to deploy \u0060reivews-rollout\u0060:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nargocd app create reviews-rollout --repo https:\/\/github.com\/tetrateio\/tse-gitops-demo.git --path argo\/rollout --dest-server https:\/\/kubernetes.default.svc --dest-namespace bookinfo --sync-policy automated\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nNote: We can use the \u0060argocd\u0060 command to deploy or use \u0060kubectl apply\u0060. It is recommended to use \u0060argocd\u0060 because you can view the deployment status in ArgoCD UI and Argo Rollouts Dashboard at the same time and manage the deployment using the \u0060argocd\u0060 command.\n\nView the status of the \u0060reviews\u0060 rollouts in the [Argo Rollouts Dashboard](https:\/\/localhost:3001\/rollouts\/bookinfo), and use the following command to send traffic to the \u0060reviews\u0060 service for a period of time:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nexport GATEWAY_HOSTNAME=$(kubectl -n bookinfo get service tsb-gateway-bookinfo -o jsonpath=\u0027{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}\u0027)\nwhile 1;do curl -H \u0022Host: bookinfo.tetrate.com\u0022 http:\/\/$GATEWAY_HOSTNAME\/api\/v1\/products\/1\/reviews;sleep 3;done\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nYou will see responses from pods with different rollouts-pod-template-hash labels in the output, which proves that canary deployment is effective. After about 10 minutes, the Argo Rollouts Dashboard you see will be as shown in Figure 5.\n\n![Figure 5: Argo Rollout Dashboard](f5.png)\n\nFrom Figure 5, we can see that canary deployment is progressing smoothly and has reached the third step. This is because the \u0060apdex\u0060 (Application Performance Index) indicator of the \u0060reviews\u0060 service is normal. You can use [Postman to submit GraphQL queries to SkyWalking](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/how-to-use-graphql-to-query-observability-data-from-skywalking-with-postman\/) to verify this, as shown in Figure 6.\n\n![Figure 6: Submitting GraphQL queries to SkyWalking using Postman](f6.png)\n\nThe GraphQL query statement we built is as follows:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060graphql\nquery ReadMetricsValues {\n    readMetricsValues(condition: {\n    name: \u0022service_apdex\u0022, entity: {scope: Service, serviceName: \u0022canary|reviews|bookinfo|cluster-1|-\u0022, normal: true}\n  }, duration: {\n    start: \u00222023-07-13 0812\u0022,\n    end: \u00222023-07-13 0813\u0022,\n    step: MINUTE\n  }) {\n        label\n        values {\n            values {\n                id\n                value\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThis statement queries the \u0060apdex\u0060 indicator of the \u0060canary|reviews|bookinfo|cluster-1|-\u0060 service from UTC \u00602023-07-13 8:12\u0060 to \u00602023 8:13\u0060 for two minutes and obtains the following results:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060json\n{\n    \u0022data\u0022: {\n        \u0022readMetricsValues\u0022: {\n            \u0022label\u0022: null,\n            \u0022values\u0022: {\n                \u0022values\u0022: [\n                    {\n                        \u0022id\u0022: \u0022service_apdex_202307130812_Y2FuYXJ5fHJldmlld3N8Ym9va2luZm98Y2x1c3Rlci0xfC0=.1\u0022,\n                        \u0022value\u0022: 10000\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \u0022id\u0022: \u0022service_apdex_202307130813_Y2FuYXJ5fHJldmlld3N8Ym9va2luZm98Y2x1c3Rlci0xfC0=.1\u0022,\n                        \u0022value\u0022: 10000\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThe value of the \u0060apdex\u0060 indicator is greater than 9900 (the threshold configured in the \u0060successCondition\u0060 of AnalysisTemplate), so Rollouts will progress smoothly. You can also click Promote manually on the Argo Rollouts Dashboard to promote it, or run the following command:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl argo rollouts promote reviews-rollout -n bookinf\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## Cleaning Up\n\nDelete the deployed ArgoCD Apps and Rollouts:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nargocd app delete -y reviews-rollout\nargocd app delete -y bookinfo-tse-conf\nargocd app delete -y bookinfo-app\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## Principles of Argo Rollouts\n\nWhen integrating with Istio, Argo Rollouts supports traffic splitting based on VirtualService and Subset, as shown in Figure 7.\n\n![Figure 7: Argo Rollouts uses Istio for traffic splitting](f7.svg)\n\nThe table below provides a detailed comparison of these two traffic segmentation methods.\n\n| Type | Applicable Scenario | Resource Object | Principle |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Host-level Traffic Split | Applicable for accessing different versions of services based on hostname; | 2 Services, 1 VirtualService, 1 Rollout; | Rollout injects the rollouts-pod-template-hash label into the ReplicaSet and selects pods with these labels by updating the selector in the Service; |\n| Subset-level Traffic Split | Applicable for accessing different services based on labels; | 1 Service, 1 VirtualService, 1 DestinationRule, and 1 Rollout; | Rollout injects the rollouts-pod-template-hash label into the ReplicaSet and selects pods with these labels by updating the selector in the DestinationRule; |\n\nSubset-based traffic splitting is used in this demo, and Argo Rollouts continuously:\n\n- modify the VirtualService \u0060spec.http[].route[].weight\u0060 to match the current desired canary weight\n- modify the DestinationRule \u0060spec.subsets[].labels\u0060 to contain the \u0060rollouts-pod-template-hash\u0060 label of the canary and stable ReplicaSets\n\nVisit [Argo Rollouts documentation](https:\/\/argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/features\/traffic-management\/istio\/) for details on using Istio for traffic management.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis article introduces how to use the Argo project and Istio to achieve GitOps and canary deployment. First, we use ArgoCD to achieve GitOps, and then use Argo Rollout and SkyWalking to achieve automated canary release. From the demo, we can see that the Istio deployed by TSE is fully compatible with the open-source version. There are many features of TSE worth exploring, visit the [Tetrate website](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/tetrate-service-express\/) for more information.\n\n---\n\n*This blog was originally published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/implementing-gitops-and-canary-deployment-with-argo-project-and-istio\/).*\n', '\/en\/blog\/implementing-gitops-and-canary-deployment-with-argo-project-and-istio\/')">

It first introduces GraphQL and SkyWalking, then explains how to set up Postman to send GraphQL queries, and finally provides some example GraphQL queries that can be used to query observability data from SkyWalking.', '\nIn this article, I will explain how to use [GraphQL](https:\/\/graphql.org\/) to query data from [SkyWalking](https:\/\/skywalking.apache.org\/) with [Postman](https:\/\/www.postman.com\/). It includes steps to obtain the bearer token, construct a query to retrieve load metrics for a specific service, and use GraphQL introspection to see the schema of SkyWalking GraphQL APIs. The article also provides references for further information.\n\n## What Is GraphQL?\n\nGraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs developed by Facebook. It provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to traditional REST APIs by allowing clients to specify exactly what data they need and receive only that data in response. With GraphQL, clients can query multiple resources in a single request, reducing the number of roundtrips to the server and improving performance.\n\n## What’s the Difference between GraphQL and REST APIs?\n\nGraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need, while REST APIs require clients to retrieve everything in a resource regardless of whether they need it or not. Additionally, GraphQL allows clients to query multiple resources in a single request, making it more efficient and less chatty than REST APIs.\n\n## How Do I Query Data from SkyWalking?\n\nSkyWalking defines the communication protocol for the query stage. The SkyWalking native UI and CLI use this protocol to consistently fetch data from the backend, without needing to worry about backend updates.\n\nThere are two methods for querying metrics from SkyWalking:\n\n1. [GraphQL APIs](https:\/\/skywalking.apache.org\/docs\/main\/v9.4.0\/en\/api\/query-protocol\/)\n2. [PromQL APIs](https:\/\/skywalking.apache.org\/docs\/main\/v9.4.0\/en\/api\/promql-service\/)\n\nThis article provides a guide on how to use GraphQL to query metrics from SkyWalking. If you are interested in the PromQL APIs, you can refer to the article[ Build Grafana dashboards for Apache SkyWalking — Native PromQL Support](https:\/\/skywalking.apache.org\/blog\/2023-03-17-build-grafana-dashboards-for-apache-skywalking-native-promql-support\/).Continuing with the following steps requires a TSB installation. If you don’t have one and still want to experience using GraphQL to query data in SkyWalking, you can use the free[ demo environment](https:\/\/skywalking.apache.org\/) (username\/password: skywalking\/skywalking) provided by SkyWalking. Log in to the demo website and get a token for queries. Endpoint address for GraphQL queries is http:\/\/demo.skywalking.apache.org\/graphql. The steps to construct the query are the same as described below.\n\n## Observe GraphQL Queries in TSB\n\nBefore we use Postman to construct our own GraphQL query, let’s first observe how TSB obtains data from SkyWalking.\n\n1. Open Chrome DevTools and switch to the Network tab.\n2. Visit the **Organization – Services** tab on the website.\n\nWatch the network request list and right-click on the one of the graphql requests, like in the following image:\n\n![Figure 1: Chrome DevTool](f1.jpg)\n\nThe curl commands you see will look like this. Execute the command in your terminal, and you will get a list of services managed by TSB from SkyWalking.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\ncurl \u0027\u003chttps:\/\/saturn.tetrate.work\/ui\/graphql\u003e\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Accept-Language: en,zh-CN;q=0.9,zh;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.7,zh-TW;q=0.6\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Cache-Control: no-cache\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Client-Timestamp: 1686104776136\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Connection: keep-alive\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Content-Type: application\/json\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Cookie: ...\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Origin: \u003chttps:\/\/saturn.tetrate.work\u003e\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Pragma: no-cache\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Referer: \u003chttps:\/\/saturn.tetrate.work\/mp\/services\u003e\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Request-Id: ...\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027User-Agent: Mozilla\/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/114.0.0.0 Safari\/537.36\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027X-Bridge-Csrf-Token: IOmJszLAqY3TRIUNhTuGu7vQgnfQY1FtgYFm\u002bl\/\u002bMu4EmVQU5T8EaQ7bngkCv4hQ12ZGids\u002bI21pHMdepE9\/qQ==\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027X-Csrf-Token: xTbxZerD3t8N3PaS7nbjKCfxk1Q9dtvvrx4D\u002bIJohHicb0VfB4iAZaP0zh1eXDWctQyCYZWaKLhAYT3M6Drk3A==\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027accept: application\/json\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027sec-ch-ua: \u0022Not.A\/Brand\u0022;v=\u00228\u0022, \u0022Chromium\u0022;v=\u0022114\u0022, \u0022Google Chrome\u0022;v=\u0022114\u0022\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027sec-ch-ua-platform: \u0022macOS\u0022\u0027 \\\n  --data-raw $\u0027{\u0022query\u0022:\u0022query ServiceRegistryListMetrics(...)}\u0027 \\\n  --compressed\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**Note:** *Some fields in the above example are too long and replaced with dots (…)*.\n\nNext, I will guide you through constructing a query to retrieve the load metrics for a specific service.\n\n## Obtain the Bearer Token\n\nFirstly, you need to obtain the bearer of the website. Log in to TSB UI, click on the user button in the upper right corner, and then click “Show token information”. In the pop-up window, you will see the Bearer Token, as shown in the following image.\n\n![Figure 2: Get the bearer token from the TSB UI](f2.jpg)\n\n**Note:** The validity period of the bearer token is relatively short. When it expires, you need to log in to TSB again to obtain a new token.\n\nWe have already deployed the[ bookinfo application](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/examples\/bookinfo\/) in advance and sent some test traffic. To query the load metrics of reviews using GraphQL in the Postman client, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a new GraphQL request and enter the request URL: \u0060$TSB_ADDRESS\/graphql\u0060\n2. Add the \u0060Authorization\u0060 header with the value\u0060 Bearer $TOKEN\u0060\n\nUse GraphQL Introspection to see the schema of SkyWalking GraphQL APIs. Find and click the \u0060readMetricsValues\u0060 item. You will see the variables on the right side. Fill in the \u0060condition\u0060 and \u0060duration\u0060 items, as shown in the following image.\n\n![Figure 3: Postman query](f3.jpg)\n\nThe variables look like this:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060graphql\nquery ReadMetricsValues {\n    readMetricsValues(condition: {\n    name: \u0022service_cpm\u0022, entity: {scope: Service, serviceName: \u0022reviews\u0022, normal: true}\n  }, duration: {\n    start: \u00222023-06-05 0625\u0022,\n    end: \u00222023-06-05 0627\u0022,\n    step: MINUTE\n  }) {\n        label\n        values {\n            values {\n                id\n                value\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nClick the **Query** button to get the result. It should look similar to this:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060json\n{\n    \u0022data\u0022: {\n        \u0022readMetricsValues\u0022: {\n            \u0022label\u0022: null,\n            \u0022values\u0022: {\n                \u0022values\u0022: [\n                    {\n                        \u0022id\u0022: \u0022service_cpm_202306050625_cmV2aWV3cw==.1\u0022,\n                        \u0022value\u0022: 0\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \u0022id\u0022: \u0022service_cpm_202306050626_cmV2aWV3cw==.1\u0022,\n                        \u0022value\u0022: 0\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \u0022id\u0022: \u0022service_cpm_202306050627_cmV2aWV3cw==.1\u0022,\n                        \u0022value\u0022: 0\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThe above is using the SkyWalking Demo environment to test GraphQL queries. GraphQL query support is also provided in TSE, and the endpoint address is \u0060https:\/\/$TSB_SERVER\/graphql\u0060.\n\n**Note:** The query endpoint here is different from what we see in DevTool. The GraphQL query endpoint specific to the TSB UI is \u0060https:\/\/$TSB_SERVER\/ui\/graphql\u0060.For details about the SkyWalking GraphQL Query Protocol, please refer to[ GitHub](https:\/\/github.com\/apache\/skywalking-query-protocol\/tree\/master).\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this article, I have introduced how to use the GraphQL query protocol in Postman to query data in SkyWalking. You can construct your own query conditions based on the GraphQL schema of SkyWalking. This feature is also available in TSB\/TSE.\n\n## References\n\n- https:\/\/github.com\/apache\/skywalking-query-protocol\n- [SkyWalking Website](https:\/\/skywalking.apache.org\/)\n\n---\n\n*This blog was originally published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/what-is-tproxy-and-how-does-it-work\/).*\n', '\/en\/blog\/how-to-use-graphql-to-query-observability-data-from-skywalking-with-postman\/')">

It highlights the new features and improvements, such as ambient mode, which allows Istio to run on any Kubernetes cluster without requiring a dedicated control plane. It also explains how to get started with Istio 1.18 using Tetrate’s distribution and support.', '\nIn June, [Istio 1.18 was released](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/news\/releases\/1.18.x\/announcing-1.18\/), marking the second release of Istio in 2023 and the first to offer official support for [ambient mode](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/istio-ambient-mesh-merged-to-main\/). Tetrate’s Paul Merrison was one of the release managers for this version, and Tetrate’s contributions to this release included various customer-driven usability enhancements and important work in the underlying Envoy Proxy upon which Istio depends. When asked about the experience of working on Istio 1.18, Paul said “working as the lead release manager for Istio 1.18 gave me a fascinating insight into how a group of super talented people from around the world come together, organize themselves and ship software. There was a steep learning curve, but the Istio community is awesome and I was supported brilliantly. The biggest challenge was definitely learning and executing all the steps that are needed to bring a release to life, but the feeling of achievement when it finally made its way out into the world will stay with me for a while!” Istio first announced the introduction of Ambient mode in September last year, which was covered in detail by Zack in[ this blog post](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/ambient-mesh-what-you-need-to-know-about-this-experimental-new-deployment-model-for-istio\/), where he explains the differences between ambient mode and sidecar mode.\n\nThis release introduces many [new features and changes](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/news\/releases\/1.18.x\/announcing-1.18\/change-notes\/) in addition to ambient mode, including enhanced Kubernetes Gateway API support, health checks for virtual machines that are not automatically registered, support for expired metrics, enhanced \u0060istioctl analyze\u0060, and more. See the [release blog](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/news\/releases\/1.18.x\/announcing-1.18\/) for details. The most significant of these are the ambient mode and Gateway API enhancements, detailed below.\n\n\u003e “Working as the lead release manager for Istio 1.18 gave me a fascinating insight into how a group of super talented people from around the world come together, organize themselves and ship software.

Sidecar mode is the default data plane mode used by Istio, where each application pod comes equipped with a sidecar proxy (usually Envoy) that handles all network traffic in and out of the pod, providing Istio’s core functionality such as Zero Trust security, telemetry and traffic management. While sidecar mode is suitable for most users, ambient mode offers some advantages in specific circumstances. For more information on the differences between ambient mode and the standard sidecar mode, see[ our article on Ambient Mesh: What You Need to Know about This Experimental New Deployment Model for Istio](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/ambient-mesh-what-you-need-to-know-about-this-experimental-new-deployment-model-for-istio\/).\n\n## What Are the Design Goals of Ambient Mode?\n\n- **Non-intrusive**: Ambient mode does not require injecting sidecar proxies into the application’s pods and only requires the application to be tagged to automatically join the mesh, potentially reducing the mesh’s impact on the application.\n- **Efficient resource utilization**: Ambient mode can optimize resource utilization for some use cases by sharing the ztunnel proxy across the mesh. If certain L7 functionality of Istio is required, it can also be addressed by deploying Waypoints precisely for a ServiceAccount or Namespace, providing more control over resource consumption.\n- **Performance parity with sidecar mode**: Ambient mode initially adopted a shared proxy model based on Envoy, but during development, issues such as complex Envoy configuration were discovered, leading the Istio community to develop its shared proxy ([ztunnel](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/using-geneve-tunnels-to-implement-istio-ambient-mesh-traffic-interception\/)) based on Rust. In the future, ambient mode is expected to have comparable performance to traditional sidecar mode.\n- **Security**: Ambient mode provides TLS support by running a shared proxy ztunnel on each node, and when users require the same security as sidecar mode, they also need to deploy one or more Waypoints in each namespace to handle L7 traffic in that namespace.\n\nUsers can use \u0060istioctl x waypoint\u0060 for Waypoint configuration management. For example, running the \u0060istioctl x waypoint generate\u0060 command generates a Kubernetes Gateway API resource managed by Istio.\n\nOverall, ambient mode promises to offer additional flexibility to Istio’s deployment model which may prove helpful to some users. It should be noted that the ambient mode is still in the **alpha stage** and has yet to achieve production-level stability.\n\n## Enhanced Kubernetes Gateway API Support\n\nIstio 1.18 introduces several vital improvements and modifications to its Kubernetes Gateway API support:\n\n- **Support for v1beta1**: When upgrading to the new version of Istio, Gateway API version greater than 0.6.0\u002b is required. Use the \u0060istioctl x precheck \u0060command to check for upgrade issues.\n- **Gateway API automated deployment management upgrades**: All Kubernetes Gateway resources Istio manages will automatically configure Service and Deployment resources when created or updated. If the Gateway resource changes, the associated configuration will also be updated synchronously. In addition, the deployment of Gateway resources no longer depends on injection logic but has an independent creation process.\n- **Removal of support for the \u0060proxy.istio.io\/config\u0060 annotation**: The ProxyConfig resource only affects the Istio-managed Gateway.\n- **Fixes to Istiod handling of configuration changes**: If Service and Deployment configurations change, Istiod reprocesses them.\n\n- **It no longer supports the Alpha version of the Gateway API by default**: It can be re-enabled by setting \u0060PILOT_ENABLE_ALPHA_GATEWAY_API=true\u0060.\n\nIt is worth noting that when installing ambient mode, unlike previous Istio installations, IngressGateway is no longer included by default. In future development, Istio is leaning towards using the Gateway API to manage gateways. For more information on why the Gateway API is recommended over Ingress, please read[ my previous blog article on why the Gateway API Is the unified future of ingress for Kubernetes and service mesh](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/why-the-gateway-api-is-the-unified-future-of-ingress-for-kubernetes-and-service-mesh\/).\n\n## Next Steps to Ambient Mesh\n\nWe’re excited that ambient mode is now available to users in an official Istio release, especially as it promises to make mesh adoption easier for all users. The [easiest way to get started with Istio’s new ambient mode is Tetrate Istio Distro](https:\/\/istio.tetratelabs.io\/), Tetrate’s hardened, fully upstream Istio distribution, with [FIPS-verified builds](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/how-tetrate-istio-distro-became-the-first-fips-compliant-istio-distribution\/) and [support available](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/tetrate-istio-subscription\/). It’s a great way to get started with Istio knowing you have a trusted distribution, to begin with, an expert team supporting you, and also the option to get to FIPS compliance quickly if you need to.\n\nAs you add more apps to the mesh, you’ll need a unified way to manage those deployments and coordinate the mandates of the different teams involved. That’s where Tetrate Service Bridge comes in.

              <a href="#" onclick="exportToMarkdown('Using Geneve Tunnels to Implement Istio Ambient Mesh Traffic Interception', 'This article introduces Geneve tunnels, a network virtualization protocol that can intercept Istio ambient mesh traffic more flexibly and securely than VXLAN. It also explains how Istio Ambient Mesh uses Geneve tunnels and the new eBPF mode in Istio 1.18.', '\nIn a previous[ blog post](\/en\/blog\/ambient-mesh-l7-traffic-path\/), I discussed how Istio Ambient Mesh uses iptables and Geneve tunnels to intercept traffic from application pods into Ztunnel. Many readers may not be familiar with this tunneling protocol, so this article will introduce the definition, packet structure and advantages of Geneve tunnels compared with the VXLAN protocol. Finally, this article will introduce how Istio Ambient Mesh applies Geneve tunnels to implement traffic interception and the new eBPF mode introduced in Istio 1.18.\n\n## Introduction to Geneve Tunnels\n\nIn order to address the lack of flexibility and security in current data transmissions, the Geneve (Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation) network virtualization encapsulation (tunneling) protocol was created. Geneve only defines a data encapsulation format, excluding control plane information. The key advantage of Geneve over VXLAN encapsulation is that it extends the types of encapsulated protocols by adding TLV format options.\n\n### Geneve vs. VXLAN\n\nVXLAN and Geneve are both network virtualization protocols and they have many similarities. Virtualization protocols are technologies that separate virtual networks from physical networks. They allow network administrators to create multiple virtual networks in a virtual environment, each of which can have its own VLAN identifiers, IP addresses and routing. In addition, VXLAN and Geneve use UDP encapsulation, which enables them to be extended through existing network infrastructure. VXLAN and Geneve protocols are also flexible, can be used in different network topologies and are compatible with different virtualization platforms.\n\nFigure 1 shows the message structure of VXLAN and Geneve tunnels and the differences in their respective headers.\n\n![Figure 1: VXLAN and Geneve packet format schematic diagram.](vxlan-vs-geneve.svg)\n\nFrom the figure, we can see that the message structure of VXLAN and Geneve tunneling protocols is similar, with the main difference being the use of different UDP port numbers and protocol headers. VXLAN uses port 4789, while Geneve uses port 6081. The Geneve protocol header is more extendable than VXLAN.\n\nThe Geneve tunneling protocol adds variable-length options that can contain zero or more option data in TLV format, making it more scalable than VXLAN. TLV stands for Type-Length-Value, which is a format for parsing and transmitting metadata in network packets. Each metadata information in the Geneve protocol is composed of a TLV format field, making it simple to flexibly add, delete and modify these metadata.\n\nThe TLV format field contains the following data:\n\n- Type: 8-bit type field.\n- Length: 5-bit option length field, represented in multiples of 4 bytes, excluding the option header.\n- Data: Variable-length option data field, which may not exist or may be between 4 and 128 bytes.\n\nThe Geneve protocol can easily modify and extend metadata information while maintaining compatibility and flexibility by using the TLV format.\n\nPlease refer to[ RFC 7348 Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN): A Framework for Overlaying Virtualized Layer 2 Networks over Layer 3 Networks](https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc7348) for more information about VXLAN. For more information about the Geneve tunnel packet format, please refer to[ RFC 8926 Geneve: Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation](https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/rfc\/rfc8926#name-geneve-packet-format-over-i).\n\n### How it Works\n\nThe Geneve tunnel is mainly used in cloud computing and virtualization scenarios, and it can encapsulate packets in a new packet for transmission in a virtual network. The Geneve tunnel uses a 24-bit VNI (Virtual Network Identifier) to transmit packets from one physical network to another. The Geneve tunnel can also use security protocols such as IPsec and TLS to protect the transmission of packets.\n\nWhen a packet reaches the destination host, the Geneve tunnel protocol will de-encapsulate the packet from the Geneve protocol header and deliver it to the destination in the virtual network. During the de-encapsulation process, the VNI information in the Geneve protocol header is used to determine the destination of the packet, ensuring that the packet is correctly routed to the destination in the virtual network.\n\nAssuming there is a virtual network with a VNI of 1001. When a packet is transmitted from one physical network to another, a tunnel can be used to track the packet during transmission by setting the VNI between the source and target physical networks to 1001. When the packet reaches the target physical network, the VNI is removed from the packet and the packet is delivered to the target physical network.\n\n### Security\n\nThe Geneve tunnel protocol itself does not provide any security mechanisms, so packets transmitted in the Geneve tunnel can be subject to threats such as packet tampering, interception and replay.\n\nTo ensure the security of packets transmitted in the Geneve tunnel, some security protocols can be used. The following are some common security protocols:\n\n1. IPsec (Internet Protocol Security): IPsec is a network layer security protocol that can encrypt, authenticate and provide integrity protection to packets in the Geneve tunnel. IPsec can provide end-to-end security.\n2. TLS (Transport Layer Security): TLS is an encryption protocol based on the transport layer that can encrypt and authenticate packets in the Geneve tunnel. TLS can provide end-to-end security.\n3. MACSec (Media Access Control Security): MACSec is a data link layer security protocol that can encrypt and authenticate packets in the Geneve tunnel. MACSec can provide link-layer security.\n\nIt should be noted that the above security protocols require corresponding configuration and deployment and may have a certain impact on performance. When choosing the appropriate security protocol, factors such as security, performance, manageability and other aspects need to be considered.\n\n## Why Choose Geneve?\n\nThe following table compares the characteristics of VXLAN and Geneve in multiple aspects.\n\n| **Feature**   | **VXLAN**                          | **Geneve**                                   |\n| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| Header format | Fixed format                       | Extensible format                            |\n| Scalability   | More focused on L2 extension       | Better support for emerging network services |\n| Operability   | Difficult to manage and extend     | Easier to manage and extend                  |\n| Performance   | Shorter header, higher performance | Longer header, slightly lower performance    |\n\n**Table 1:** *VXLAN vs Geneve characteristics*.\n\nThe main reason for using the Geneve protocol is to combine the advantages of current network virtualization encapsulation technologies (such as VXLAN, NVGRE and STT) into one protocol. Through years of network virtualization development experience, we know that one of the most important requirements is scalability. The Geneve protocol encodes metadata using an extensible TLV structure, so it can independently develop the functionality of software and hardware endpoints to meet growing needs.\n\n## How Istio Ambient Mesh Applies Geneve Tunnels\n\nIn the[ previous blog](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/transparent-traffic-intercepting-and-routing-in-the-l4-network-of-istio-ambient-mesh\/), I explained how Istio Ambient Mesh uses Ztunnel to implement L4 proxies and Figure 2 shows the L4 transparent traffic interception path using iptables and Geneve tunnels.\n\n![Figure 2: L4 Transparent Traffic Interception Path Using Iptables and Geneve Tunnels.](geneve-tunnel.svg)\nFrom the figure, we can see that:\n\n- The Istio CNI creates an \u0060istioout\u0060 network card and iptables rules on the node, transparently intercepting the outbound traffic in the node to the \u0060pistioout\u0060 virtual network card.\n- The Istio CNI creates an \u0060istioin\u0060 network card and iptables rules on the node, transparently intercepting the inbound traffic in the node to the \u0060pistioin\u0060 virtual network card.\n- The Istio CNI creates \u0060pistioin\u0060 and \u0060pistioout\u0060 network cards in ztunnel to receive data packets in the Geneve tunnel.\n\nThe two network cards \u0060pistioin\u0060 and \u0060pistioout\u0060 are created by the init container or Istio CNI (see the \u0060CreateRulesWithinNodeProxyNS\u0060 function in [net_linux.go](https:\/\/github.com\/istio\/istio\/blob\/master\/cni\/pkg\/ambient\/net_linux.go#L910)), and their IP addresses and ports are fixed. The data packets sent by the application container need to pass through the \u0060istioout\u0060 network card and be forwarded to the ztunnel container after being encapsulated in the Geneve tunnel. When the data packets are received by the ztunnel container, they are de-encapsulated and forwarded to the corresponding application containers through the \u0060pistioin\u0060 network card.\n\n## Using eBPF for Transparent Traffic Interception\n\neBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is a powerful technology that allows secure user-space programs to run within the Linux kernel. Initially developed as a technique for filtering network packets, eBPF has now been extended to other areas such as tracking system calls, performance analysis and security monitoring. The advantages of eBPF are its lightweight nature, efficiency, security and programmability. It can be used in real-time monitoring, network security, application debugging and optimization, container networking and various other fields.\n\nIstio Ambient Mesh also supports using the eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) mode for transparent traffic interception since 1.18. As shown in Figure 3, the eBPF program runs directly in the host kernel and forwards application traffic to ztunnel. Compared to the iptables-based approach, the eBPF mode can provide better network efficiency and scalability. However, it requires a higher version of the Linux kernel and is more difficult to implement.\n\n![Figure 3: Intercepting the Traffic of Application Using eBPF.](ebpf.svg)\n\nTo use the eBPF mode to run Ambient Mesh, simply set the \u0060values.cni.ambient.redirectMode\u0060 parameter to “ebpf” when installing Istio, as shown below:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nistioctl install --set profile=ambient --set values.cni.ambient.redirectMode=\u0022ebpf\u0022\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## Summary\n\nThis article introduced the working principle, security and comparison with VXLAN of the Geneve tunnel protocol. In addition, it also introduced how Istio Ambient Mesh uses Geneve tunnels to implement traffic interception and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of using eBPF for transparent traffic interception. The Geneve tunnel protocol is a universal tunneling protocol that can transmit packets in virtual networks, and it has more advantages than other tunneling protocols. Therefore, when choosing a tunneling protocol, users can consider using the Geneve tunnel. In Istio 1.18, the eBPF mode of Ambient Mesh is newly introduced, which can provide better network efficiency, but has higher requirements for the Linux kernel version. Users can choose according to their actual situation.\n\n## References\n\n- [RFC 7348 Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN): A Framework for Overlaying Virtualized Layer 2 Networks over Layer 3 Networks](https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc7348)\n- [RFC 8926 Geneve: Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation](https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/rfc\/rfc8926#name-geneve-packet-format-over-i)\n- [Istio Ambient Mesh](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/ops\/deployment\/architecture\/#istio-ambient-mesh)\n- [Open vSwitch Geneve(8) man page](https:\/\/www.mankier.com\/8\/ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5))\n\n---\n\nIf you’re new to service mesh and Kubernetes security, we have a bunch of free online courses [available at Tetrate Academy](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/academy) that will quickly get you up to speed with Istio and Envoy.\n\nIf you’re looking for a fast way to get to production with Istio, check out [Tetrate Istio Distribution (TID)](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/tid) .

              <a href="#" onclick="exportToMarkdown('Envoy Gateway 0.4.0: Extending the API for Customization', 'In this blog post, we will discuss the new customizations available in this release and their significance for users.', '\n[Envoy Gateway](https:\/\/github.com\/envoyproxy\/gateway), the open-source API Gateway based on Envoy Proxy, has just released version 0.4.0. This release is centered around customization, with the goal of enabling more use cases for end-users. In this blog post, we will discuss the new customizations available in this release and their significance for users.\n\n## Customizing Envoy Proxy Infrastructure\n\nOne of the main customizations in this release is the ability to configure the exact type of EnvoyProxy (CRD) deployment. You can define the number of replicas, images, and resource limits that EnvoyProxy deploys. You can also add annotations to EnvoyProxy deployments and services. This makes different use cases possible, such as:\n\n- Linking Envoy Gateway to external load balancers like AWS, NLB, ELB, and GCP.\n- Injecting a sidecar alongside EnvoyProxy is very useful for managing the North-South traffic in the Envoy Gateway at the ingress layer and for managing the East-West traffic and enabling mutual TLS (mTLS) in the service mesh layer with the Envoy sidecar. This custom feature eliminates the need for users to create their own certificates, as it is based on Istio certificate management.\n\nRefer to the Envoy Gateway documentation for more customized features on Envoy Gateway.\n\n## Multi-Tenant Deployment Modes\n\nFurthermore, Envoy Gateway has added support for other deployment modes in addition to the default Kubernetes single-tenant mode, such as multi-tenancy, as shown in Figure 1 below.\n\n![Figure 1: Envoy Gateway multi-tenancy deployment mode.](eg-multi-tenancy.svg)\n\nDeploy an Envoy Gateway Controller to each tenant’s namespace, which watches HTTPRoute and Service resources in Kubernetes, and creates and manages EnvoyProxy deployments in their respective namespaces.\n\n## Customizing Envoy xDS Bootstrap\n\nAnother significant customization in this release is the ability to customize the Envoy xDS Bootstrap. With this feature, users can provide a bootstrap configuration to configure some static resources when starting up Envoy. A good case is configuring access logging, tracing and metrics to be sent to SkyWalking, which can work as an APM. Additionally, the release adds a lot of CLI tooling to help validate user configuration. Users can use the CLI as a dry run to change a specific field in Bootstrap, and it will fail if the config is not syntactically correct.\n\n## Extending the Control Plane\n\nEnvoy Gateway now provides the ability to allow vendors and extension developers to add gRPC hooks at different stages of the Envoy Gateway pipeline to further extend its functionality, allowing users to do things like enhance the xDS configuration being sent to Envoy, which was not possible before.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn conclusion, Envoy Gateway 0.4.0 extends the API for customization and enables more use cases for end-users. The new customizations include the ability to customize Envoy deployment, Envoy xDS Bootstrap, and the control plane. With the release of this version, Envoy Gateway is becoming more user-friendly and is positioning itself as a great alternative to ingress-nginx.\n\n*This blog was initially published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/envoy-gateway-0-4-0-extending-the-api-for-customization\/)*.\n', '\/en\/blog\/envoy-gateway-customization\/')">
