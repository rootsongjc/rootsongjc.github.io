              <a href="#" onclick="exportToMarkdown('A Journey in Paris — Capturing the Spring of France', 'In March 2024, I visited Paris during KubeCon EU, experiencing the local culture, cuisine, and daily life nuances.', '\nIn March 2024, I had the special opportunity to visit Paris, France, for [KubeCon EU 2024](\/en\/blog\/kubecon-eu-paris-recap\/), a gathering of cloud computing and open-source enthusiasts from around the globe. Utilizing this chance, I not only gained insights into the latest technological trends but also embraced the history, culture, and everyday life of this city. My Parisian adventure spanned from March 16th to the 24th, during which I explored as much of this enchanting city as possible.\n\n## Visa Chapter\n\nFor us Chinese, obtaining a visa is always the first step to traveling abroad. The French Schengen visa, requiring a multitude of documents including a company sponsorship letter and itinerary, was made relatively easier by my company\u0027s profile. Fortunately, unlike the Japanese visa, the French visa did not require freezing substantial funds or showing a hefty bank deposit. I received a six-month visa, offering more flexibility and possibilities for my future travels in Europe.\n\n## Arriving in Paris\n\nThe journey from Beijing to Paris was filled with anticipation. I flew with Air France, departing in the early hours from Beijing and, after a 13-hour flight, arrived in Paris early in the morning. On my way back, I chose to transit through Istanbul, adding an exotic touch to my travel memories.\n\n## First Impressions\n\nThe Charles de Gaulle Airport was adorned with elegant Chinese signs everywhere, reflecting the French attention to detail. Although the customs process took nearly an hour, the diverse crowd reinforced the international vibe of Paris. Navigating the metro, I attempted three times before successfully boarding due to the crowd. Using Bolt taxi service, a kind Frenchman helped me communicate with the driver in French, showcasing the warmth and friendliness of the locals.\n\nHere are the translations for the image captions:\n\n![Charles de Gaulle Airport](custom.webp)\n\n## Parisian Daily Details\n\nIn every corner of Paris, you can see uniquely designed trash bins that are not only practical but also consider safety. Some are explosion-proof for glass bottles and cans, while others are simply covered with clear plastic bags for the same reason. These details reflect the meticulous and thoughtful city management.\n\n![Parisian Street Trash Bins](dustbin.webp)\n\n## Dining in Paris\n\nDespite the allure of Western steaks and pastries, I found myself craving the flavors of home. In Paris, I discovered a Sichuan restaurant named Yang\u0027s Kitchen; their beef noodle soup, while different from those back home, was delicious and reasonably priced. Additionally, the street fruits in Paris were not only more affordable but also tastier than those I usually purchase online, especially the pears I love.\n\n![Chinese and Western Cuisine in Paris, including Macarons](food.webp)\n\n![Street Stalls and Bakeries in Paris](store.webp)\n\n## Living in Paris\n\nParis, the capital of France, is renowned for its romance and history and has a unique administrative structure. The city is typically divided into \u0022Greater Paris\u0022 and \u0022Lesser Paris,\u0022 with Lesser Paris referring to the inner city from the 1st to the 20th arrondissement, covering most of the famous historical landmarks and cultural areas. Greater Paris includes the suburbs around Lesser Paris, forming a broader metropolitan area.\n\n![Map of Lesser Paris](paris-map.webp)\n\n![Comparison of the Area of Lesser Paris and Beijing\u0027s Third Ring Road](paris-vs-beijing.webp)\n\n## Navigating Paris\n\nParis\u0027s street planning is unique; the roads crisscross in non-strict north-south directions, and with traffic lights set on street corners, it can be disorienting for newcomers. The city\u0027s bike lanes are well-developed; I rented a power-assisted bicycle, experiencing an unprecedented sense of freedom cruising through the streets of Paris. The metro system is complex yet comprehensive, with a convenient payment system that mostly accepts credit cards.\n\n![Bike Lanes on Paris Streets](bike.webp)\n\n![Paris Metro](metro.webp)\n\n## Healthcare Experience\n\nThe second day in Paris, I suffered from diarrhea due to improper eating, which lasted two days. During this time, I visited a local pharmacy to buy medication. The pharmacy opened punctually at 8 AM, and there was always a line outside, impressing me with their timeliness and order.\n\n![Anti-diarrheal Medicine Purchased in Paris](drug.webp)\n\n## Sightseeing in Paris\n\nDuring the KubeCon EU, I used my spare time to visit several of Paris\u0027s famous attractions. The Eiffel Tower was a must-see; I ascended to the second-floor platform, which offered a spectacular view of the entire city. The Louvre, a haven for art lovers, drew countless visitors to Mona Lisa\u0027s enigmatic smile. Although the Notre-Dame was under repair, its charm at night remained irresistible.\n\n![The Louvre Museum](louvre.webp)\n\n![Foucault\u0027s Pendulum inside the Pantheon](pantheon.webp)\n\n![The Seine River](seine.webp)\n\n![Madeleine Church](madeleine.webp)\n\n![Sacré-Cœur Basilica](basilique.webp)\n\n## About the Olympics\n\nThe modern Olympics were initiated by the French in Paris. It may be that the French are accustomed to the Olympics, or it could be an effort to minimize disruption to local life. During my visit to Paris, I did not feel any ambiance indicative of the upcoming Olympic Games. Only a few iconic buildings had stages under construction, possibly for Olympic use, and some shops were selling Olympic memorabilia.\n\n## Comments\n\nRecently, there have been several videos on Chinese internet platforms depicting the poor security and environmental conditions in Paris, such as prevalent street theft, public urination, and a lack of public restrooms. Fortunately, I did not encounter any thieves nor did my companions. However, I did notice a urine smell, especially around tourist areas, and encountered a few homeless people asking for cigarettes. Additionally, it was challenging to find restrooms in the Louvre; the only men\u0027s restroom I found was under maintenance.\n\n![Street near the Louvre filled with trash and urine smell](street.webp)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nParis, with its unique charm and rich cultural heritage, left a profound impression on me. The locals were warm and friendly, and the scenery was breathtaking. Although some tourist-heavy areas were a bit chaotic, that\u0027s an unavoidable aspect of any tourist city. My trip to Paris was filled with wonderful memories, making me look forward to visiting this romantic land again. I hope this travelogue will help those planning their first journey to this enchanting city.', '\/en\/blog\/paris-trip\/')">

Though the scenic area was not yet open, we used a drone to capture the glacier valleys.\n\n![Xiata Ancient Trail](xiata.jpg)\n\n## Yizhao Highway\n\nYizhao Highway is known as one of the most beautiful roads in Xinjiang. The scenery changes from mountains to grasslands, from forests to lakes, each view captivating. Driving along the cliffs, I couldn\u0027t help but admire the efforts of the road builders.\n\n![Yizhao Highway](yizhao-highway.jpg)\n\n## Sayram Lake\n\nOur final stop was Sayram Lake, located in the Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture. The lake\u0027s clear water, as blue as Prussian blue, is surrounded by snow-capped mountains and grasslands, creating a poetic landscape. We strolled along the lake, spent the night on the west bank, and felt the serenity and grandeur of this place known as \u0022the last tear of the Atlantic.\u0022\n\n![Sayram Lake](sayram-lake.jpg)\n\nThis road trip not only allowed me to experience the magnificent natural scenery but also the unique ethnic culture of the region. I captured the beauty of the journey with aerial footage and created a video to share with everyone.\n\n## Local Delicacies\n\nIli\u0027s scenic beauty is matched by its delicious food. The tender roasted meat on red willow skewers, spicy and flavorful chili meat (a local breakfast paired with steamed buns), the numbing and spicy pepper chicken, and the fragrant fried rice with mountain salmon roe from Sayram Lake, all left a lasting impression.\n\n![Clockwise from top left: fried rice with mountain salmon roe, roasted meat on red willow skewers, chili meat, pepper chicken](food.jpg)\n\nXinjiang\u0027s dried fruits, cheese, and beef jerky also make great souvenirs.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis journey will be a memorable chapter in my life. The beauty and charm of Xinjiang Ili have deeply captivated me. If given the chance, I will surely return to explore more unexplored landscapes.\n\nI hope this travelogue brings you some beautiful memories of Xinjiang Ili. If you have the opportunity to travel to Xinjiang, don\u0027t miss these stunning spots.\n', '\/en\/blog\/xinjiang-ili-trip\/')">

Christian Posta\u0027s in-depth analysis of design decisions and trade-offs between Cilium and Istio in implementing sidecar-less service mesh highlighted the potential of this model in improving performance, reducing resource consumption, and simplifying operational tasks. By analyzing the transition from Istio to Cilium at The New York Times, it further demonstrated the effectiveness of the sidecar-less model in handling complex, multi-region service meshes, while also pointing out challenges and implementation considerations in this transition. These discussions foreshadowed the potential evolution of service mesh technology towards more flexible and efficient architectures, where the sidecar-less approach may become a key strategy for optimizing the performance and resource utilization of cloud-native applications.\n\n### Intersection of Cilium and Service Mesh\n\n[Cilium](https:\/\/cilium.io) was widely discussed at KubeCon EU 2024. As a technology based on eBPF, Cilium is not only seen as an efficient Container Network Interface (CNI) but also demonstrates strong potential in the service mesh domain. Through presentations by Isovalent and other organizations, Cilium was showcased as an advanced solution for connecting, observing, and securing service mesh. In particular, Cilium\u0027s sidecar-less service mesh implementation was considered a future direction, leveraging eBPF technology to achieve secure communication and fine-grained traffic management among microservices without adding the burden of traditional sidecar proxies. Additionally, Cilium\u0027s extensibility beyond service mesh, such as in multi-cloud networking and load balancing, highlights its position as a core component of the cloud-native ecosystem. These discussions and case studies of Cilium demonstrate its significant role in driving innovation in service mesh and cloud-native technologies.\n\n## Cloud Native Trends\n\nSeveral major trends are currently shaping the cloud-native landscape:\n\n1. **Enhanced Sustainability and Environmental Awareness**: For example, Deutsche Bahn is incorporating developers into its infrastructure greening process, highlighting a growing consideration of environmental factors in the design and operation of cloud-native solutions.

[Cloud Native Community](https:\/\/cloudnative.to) is like a small society, I don\u0027t want it to have much social value, but only want it to make a small but beautiful change to individuals, to enterprises and to society. I constantly think about myself as an individual and as an employee, especially as an initiator of the community. What is my mission as an individual, an employee, and especially as an initiator of a community? What role should I play in the company? Where is this community going? I\u0027m fumbling along, but because of your support, it makes me stronger and more committed to the adoption and application of cloud native technology in China, outside of me I may have gone faster, but now with the community together we will go further!\n\n![24 June 2019, Shanghai, KubeCon China 2019](20190624.jpg)\n*June 24, 2019, Shanghai, KubeCon China 2019*\n\n## Joining Tetrate\n\nOver the past two years, I\u0027ve been working hard to promote Istio and Service Mesh technology, and with funding from Ant Group, I started the ServiceMesher Community to bring Service Mesh technology to China. Next I want to bring Chinese practice to the world.\n\nAs a Developer Advocate, the most important thing is not to stop learning, but to listen and take stock. Over the past two years, I\u0027ve seen a lot of people show interest in Service Mesh, but not enough to understand the risks and lack of knowledge about the new technology. I\u0027m excited to join this Service Mesh-focused startup [Tetrate](https:\/\/tetrate.io), a global telecommuting startup with products built around open source [Istio](https:\/\/istio.io), [Envoy](https:\/ \/envoyproxy.io) and [Apache SkyWalking](https:\/\/skywalking.apache.org\/), it aims to make it to be the cloud native network infrastructure. Here are several maintainers of these open source projects, such as [Sheng Wu](https:\/\/twitter.com\/wusheng1108), [Zack Butcher](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ZackButcher), [Lizan Zhou](https:\/\/twitter.com\/zlizan), etc., and I believe that working with them can help you understand and apply Service Mesh quickly and effectively across cloud native.\n\n## More\n\nEarlier this year as I was preparing for the Cloud Native community, I set the course for the next three years - cloud native, open source and community. The road to pursue my dream is full of thorns, not only need courage and perseverance, but also need you to be my strong backing, I will overcome the thorns and move forward. Open source belongs to the world, to let the world understand us better, we must be more active into the world. I hope that China\u0027s open source tomorrow will be better, I hope that Service Mesh technology will be better applied by the enterprises in China, I hope that cloud native can benefit the public, and I hope that we can all find our own mission. \n\nWe are hiring now, if you are interested with [Tetrate](\/en\/job\/tetrate), please send your resume to [careers@tetrate.io](mailto:careers@tetrate.io).\n', '\/en\/blog\/moving-on-from-ant-group\/')">
