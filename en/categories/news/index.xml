, offering a new solution to simplify service mesh deployment and management in multi-cluster environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ameer Abbas and John Howard from Google discussed building 99.99% reliability services with infrastructure reliability at 99.9%. They proposed a series of application architecture prototypes (Archetypes) to design and implement highly reliable multi-cluster applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototype 1: Active-Passive Zones&lt;/strong&gt; - Deploy all services in two zones of a single region, using read-only replicas of SQL databases, with fault tolerance within the zone achieved through L4 load balancers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototype 2: Multi-Zonal&lt;/strong&gt; - Deploy all services in three zones of a single region, using highly available SQL databases, with fault tolerance within the zone achieved through global or zonal load balancers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototype 3: Active-Passive Region&lt;/strong&gt; - Deploy all services in three zones of two regions, using SQL databases replicated across regions, with fault tolerance between regions achieved through DNS and load balancers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototype 4: Isolated Regions&lt;/strong&gt; - Deploy all services in three zones of two regions, using global databases like Spanner or CockroachDB, with fault tolerance between regions achieved through zonal load balancers and DNS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototype 5: Global&lt;/strong&gt; - Deploy all services in three zones of two or more regions, using global databases like Spanner or CockroachDB, with fault tolerance achieved globally through global load balancers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;security-and-zero-trust-architecture&#34;&gt;Security and Zero Trust Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;
