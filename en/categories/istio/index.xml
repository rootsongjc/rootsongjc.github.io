      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;I’m delighted to present Istio’s most recent release—&lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.19.x/announcing-1.19/&#34; title=&#34;Istio 1.19&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio 1.19&lt;/a&gt;
. This blog will provide an overview of the updates bundled in this release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gateway-api-revolutionizing-service-mesh&#34;&gt;Gateway API: Revolutionizing Service Mesh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our&lt;a href=&#34;https://tetrate.io/blog/why-the-gateway-api-is-the-unified-future-of-ingress-for-kubernetes-and-service-mesh/&#34; title=&#34; previous blog&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt; previous blog&lt;/a&gt;
 highlighted the Gateway API’s potential to harmonize ingress gateways in Kubernetes and service mesh, opening doors to cross-namespace traffic support. With Istio’s official endorsement, the Gateway API takes center stage. While traditionally applied to north-south traffic (the ingress and egress of the mesh), it now extends its prowess to the realm of east-west traffic, the lifeblood within the mesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kubernetes, services wear multiple hats, handling tasks from service discovery and DNS to workload selection, routing and load balancing. Yet, control over these functions has been limited, with workload selection being the notable exception. The Gateway API changes the game, putting you in command of service routing. This introduces some overlap with Istio’s VirtualService, as both wield influence over traffic routing. Here’s a glimpse into three scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal Kubernetes Requests:&lt;/strong&gt; Without Istio, all internal traffic in Kubernetes takes the service route.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;North-South Traffic:&lt;/strong&gt; By applying the Gateway API to the Ingress gateway, incoming traffic to Kubernetes follows xRoute (currently supporting HTTPRoute, TCPRoute and gRPCRoute) to services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;East-West Traffic:&lt;/strong&gt; Inside Istio, as traffic enters the data plane, xRoute of the Gateway API takes charge. It guides the traffic to either the original or a new destination service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-119-release/gateway-api-request.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-119-release/gateway-api-request.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Figure 1:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Traffic routing.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Figure 1:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Traffic routing.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dynamic fusion of the Gateway API with Istio not only refines service networking but also solidifies Istio’s significance in the Kubernetes ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gateway-api-for-service-mesh-a-deeper-dive&#34;&gt;Gateway API for Service Mesh: A Deeper Dive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its current experimental stage (as of v0.8.0), the Gateway API for Service Mesh introduces a fresh approach to configuring service mesh support in Kubernetes. It directly links individual route resources (such as HTTPRoute) with Service resources, streamlining the configuration process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some key takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experimental Stage:&lt;/strong&gt; As of version v0.8.0, the Gateway API for Service Mesh is still experimental. It’s advised not to use it in production environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service and Route Association:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike using Gateway and GatewayClass resources, individual route resources are linked directly with Service resources when configuring a service mesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frontend and Backend Aspects of Service:&lt;/strong&gt; The Service’s frontend encompasses its name and cluster IP, while the backend consists of its collection of endpoint IPs. This distinction facilitates routing within a mesh without introducing redundant resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Route Attachment to Service:&lt;/strong&gt; Routes are attached to a Service to apply configuration to any traffic directed to that Service. The traffic follows the mesh’s default behavior if no Routes are attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Namespace Relationships&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Same Namespace:&lt;/em&gt; A Route in the same Namespace as its Service, known as a producer route, is typically created by the workload creator to define acceptable usage. It affects all requests from any client of the workload across any Namespace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Different Namespaces:&lt;/em&gt; A Route in a different Namespace than its Service, termed a consumer route, refines how a consumer of a given workload makes requests. This Route only influences requests from workloads in the same Namespace as the Route.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-119-release/gateway-api-reference.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-119-release/gateway-api-reference.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Figure 2:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Producer Route and Consumer Route.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Figure 2:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Producer Route and Consumer Route.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combining Routes:&lt;/strong&gt; Multiple Routes for the same Service in a single Namespace, whether producer or consumer routes, will be merged according to the Gateway API Route merging rules. This means defining distinct consumer routes for multiple consumers in the same Namespace is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request Flow&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A client workload initiates a request for a specific Service in a Namespace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mesh data plane intercepts the request and identifies the target Service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on associated Routes, the request is allowed, rejected, or forwarded to the appropriate workload based on matching rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that, in the experimental stage, the Gateway API for Service Mesh may undergo further changes and is not recommended for production use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, there’s more! Our journey doesn’t end here – the support for ingress traffic using the API is rapidly heading toward General Availability, promising even more dynamic developments!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s delve further into additional enhancements in this release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ambient-mesh-enhancements&#34;&gt;Ambient Mesh Enhancements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Istio team has been tirelessly refining the ambient mesh, an innovative deployment model that offers an alternative to the traditional sidecar approach. If you haven’t explored ambient yet, now’s the perfect time to dive into the&lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/blog/2022/introducing-ambient-mesh/&#34; title=&#34; introduction blog post&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt; introduction blog post&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this update, we’ve amplified support for &lt;code&gt;ServiceEntry&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WorkloadEntry&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PeerAuthentication&lt;/code&gt; and DNS proxying. Alongside, bug fixes and reliability enhancements ensure a seamless experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the ambient mesh is in its alpha phase for this release. The Istio community eagerly awaits your feedback to propel it toward Beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;simplified-virtual-machine-and-multicluster-experiences&#34;&gt;Simplified Virtual Machine and Multicluster Experiences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simplicity is key, especially when working with Virtual Machines and Multicluster setups. In this release, we’ve made the address field optional in the &lt;code&gt;WorkloadEntry&lt;/code&gt; resources. This seemingly small adjustment promises to streamline your workflow significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;elevated-security-configurations&#34;&gt;Elevated Security Configurations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now configure &lt;code&gt;OPTIONAL_MUTUAL&lt;/code&gt; for your Istio ingress gateway’s TLS settings, providing the flexibility of optional client certificate validation. Additionally, you can fine-tune your preferred cipher suites used for non-Istio mTLS traffic via &lt;code&gt;MeshConfig&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these updates, Istio 1.19 empowers you with greater control, flexibility and security in managing your service mesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to explore these enhancements and share your experiences with the Istio community.

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy meshing!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Implementing GitOps and Canary Deployment with Argo Project and Istio</title>
      <link>https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/implementing-gitops-and-canary-deployment-with-argo-project-and-istio/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 10:18:40 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/implementing-gitops-and-canary-deployment-with-argo-project-and-istio/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The development of cloud-native applications has led to a shift in development to the left and a higher frequency of application iteration, which has given rise to the need for GitOps. This article will introduce how to use the Argo project, including ArgoCD and Argo Rollouts, to achieve GitOps and canary deployment with Istio. There is also a demonstration in the article that shows how to achieve GitOps based on the Istio environment provided by Tetrate Service Express (also applicable to Tetrate Service Bridge).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deployment architecture diagram of the demo in this article is shown in Figure 1. If you are already familiar with the deployment strategies and Argo projects introduced in this article, you can skip directly to the demo section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/implementing-gitops-and-canary-deployment-with-argo-project-and-istio/f1.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/implementing-gitops-and-canary-deployment-with-argo-project-and-istio/f1.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 1: Architecture diagram of using Istio and Argo projects in TSE/TSB to achieve GitOps and canary release&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 1: Architecture diagram of using Istio and Argo projects in TSE/TSB to achieve GitOps and canary release&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deployment-strategy&#34;&gt;Deployment strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I want to briefly introduce the two deployment strategies supported by Argo Rollouts, which can achieve zero-downtime deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steps of blue-green deployment and canary deployment are shown in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/implementing-gitops-and-canary-deployment-with-argo-project-and-istio/f2.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/implementing-gitops-and-canary-deployment-with-argo-project-and-istio/f2.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 2: Steps of blue-green deployment and canary deployment&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 2: Steps of blue-green deployment and canary deployment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blue-green deployment is a strategy that deploys the new version of the application in a separate environment in parallel without affecting the current production environment. In blue-green deployment, the current production environment is called the &amp;ldquo;blue environment,&amp;rdquo; and the environment where the new version of the application is deployed is called the &amp;ldquo;green environment.&amp;rdquo; Once the green environment is considered stable and has passed the test, the traffic will gradually switch from the blue environment to the green environment, allowing users to gradually access the new version. If problems occur during the switching process, it can be quickly rolled back to the blue environment to minimize the impact on users. The advantage of blue-green deployment is that it can provide high availability and zero-downtime deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canary deployment is a strategy for gradually introducing new versions or features into the production environment. In canary deployment, the new version or feature is first deployed to a small number of users in the production environment, called &amp;ldquo;canary users.&amp;rdquo; By monitoring the feedback and performance indicators of canary users, the development team can evaluate the stability and reliability of the new version or feature. If there are no problems, more users can be gradually included in the canary deployment until all users use the new version. If a problem is found, it can be quickly rolled back or fixed to avoid negative effects on the entire user group. The advantage of canary deployment is that it can quickly identify problems and make adjustments in a small impact area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main difference between blue-green deployment and canary deployment is the deployment method and the scale of the changes. Blue-green deployment deploys the entire application in a new environment and then switches, which is suitable for large-scale changes, such as major upgrades of the entire application. Canary deployment gradually introduces new versions or features, which is suitable for small-scale changes, such as adding or modifying a single feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of application scenarios, blue-green deployment is suitable for systems with higher requirements for high availability and zero-downtime deployment. When deploying large-scale changes, blue-green deployment can ensure stability and reliability and can quickly roll back to cope with unexpected situations. Canary deployment is suitable for systems that need to quickly verify new features or versions. By gradually introducing changes, problems can be discovered early and adjustments can be made to minimize the impact on users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;release-strategy-of-kubernetes-deployment&#34;&gt;Release strategy of Kubernetes Deployment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kubernetes, the Deployment resource object is one of the main tools for managing the deployment and updating of applications. Deployment provides a declarative way to define the expected state of an application and implements the release strategy through the controller&amp;rsquo;s functionality. The architecture of Deployment is shown in Figure 3, where the colored squares represent pods of different versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/implementing-gitops-and-canary-deployment-with-argo-project-and-istio/f3.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/implementing-gitops-and-canary-deployment-with-argo-project-and-istio/f3.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 3: Architecture diagram of Kubernetes Deployment&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 3: Architecture diagram of Kubernetes Deployment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release strategy can be configured in the spec field of Deployment. Here are some common release policy options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Management of ReplicaSet&lt;/strong&gt;: Deployment uses ReplicaSet to create and manage replicas of an application. The desired number of replicas can be specified by setting the &lt;code&gt;spec.replicas&lt;/code&gt; field. During the release process, the Kubernetes controller ensures that the number of replicas of the new version&amp;rsquo;s ReplicaSet gradually increases when created, and the number of replicas of the old version&amp;rsquo;s ReplicaSet gradually decreases when deleted to achieve a smooth switch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rolling update policy&lt;/strong&gt;: Deployment supports multiple rolling update policies, which can be selected by setting the &lt;code&gt;spec.strategy.type&lt;/code&gt; field. Common policies include:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RollingUpdate&lt;/strong&gt;: The default policy updates replicas gradually at a certain time interval. The number of replicas that are not available at the same time and the number of additional available replicas can be controlled by setting the &lt;code&gt;spec.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;spec.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxSurge&lt;/code&gt; fields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recreate&lt;/strong&gt;: This policy first deletes all replicas of the old version during the update process and then creates replicas of the new version. This policy will cause the application to be temporarily unavailable during the update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Version control&lt;/strong&gt;: Deployment sets labels for each version&amp;rsquo;s ReplicaSet through the &lt;code&gt;spec.template.metadata.labels&lt;/code&gt; field so that the controller can track and manage them accurately. This way, multiple versions of ReplicaSet can coexist, and the number of replicas of each version can be accurately controlled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using these configuration options, Deployment can achieve different release strategies. Updating the spec field of the Deployment object can trigger the release of a new version. The Kubernetes controller will automatically handle the creation, update, and deletion of replicas according to the specified policy to achieve smooth application updates and deployment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;implementing-gitops-with-argocd&#34;&gt;Implementing GitOps with ArgoCD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use Deployment to manually manage release strategies, but to achieve automation, we also need to use GitOps tools such as ArgoCD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ArgoCD is a GitOps-based continuous delivery tool used to automate and manage the deployment of Kubernetes applications. It provides some key help to improve the efficiency and reliability of application deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the help ArgoCD provides for Kubernetes application deployment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Declarative configuration&lt;/strong&gt;: ArgoCD uses a declarative way to define the expected state of an application and stores the application configuration in a Git repository. By versioning and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes, it is easy to track and manage application configuration changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous deployment&lt;/strong&gt;: ArgoCD can monitor configuration changes in the Git repository and automatically deploy the application to the Kubernetes environment. It provides customizable synchronization policies that can automatically trigger application deployment and updates, achieving continuous deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State comparison and automatic repair&lt;/strong&gt;: ArgoCD periodically checks the current state of the application and compares it with the expected state. If inconsistencies are found, it will automatically try to repair and restore the application to the desired state to ensure consistency between the expected and actual states.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-environment management&lt;/strong&gt;: ArgoCD supports managing multiple Kubernetes environments, such as development, testing, and production environments. It is easy to deploy and synchronize application configurations between different environments, ensuring consistency and controllability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to Deployment resource objects, ArgoCD provides more advanced features and workflows that complement the capabilities of native Kubernetes resource objects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitOps-based configuration management&lt;/strong&gt;: ArgoCD stores application configuration in a Git repository, enabling GitOps-based configuration management. This approach ensures that configuration changes are traceable, auditable, and can be integrated with existing CI/CD pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated deployment and continuous delivery&lt;/strong&gt;: ArgoCD can automatically detect configuration changes in the Git repository and deploy applications to Kubernetes environments, enabling automated deployment and continuous delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State management and automatic recovery&lt;/strong&gt;: ArgoCD continuously monitors the state of applications and compares it to the expected state. If inconsistencies are detected, it automatically recovers and ensures that the application state remains consistent with the expected state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-istio-to-achieve-fine-grained-traffic-routing&#34;&gt;Using Istio to achieve fine-grained traffic routing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although ArgoCD can implement GitOps, it essentially operates on Kubernetes Deployment and controls traffic routing through replica numbers. To achieve fine-grained traffic routing, services meshes like Istio are used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istio achieves finer-grained traffic routing and application release through the following methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VirtualService&lt;/strong&gt;: Istio uses VirtualService to define traffic routing rules. By configuring VirtualService, traffic can be routed and distributed based on request attributes such as request headers, paths, weights, etc., directing requests to different service instances or versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DestinationRule&lt;/strong&gt;: Istio&amp;rsquo;s DestinationRule is used to define service version policies and load balancing settings. By specifying different traffic weights between service instances of different versions, advanced application release policies such as canary release or blue-green deployment can be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traffic control and policies&lt;/strong&gt;: Istio provides rich traffic control and policy capabilities such as traffic limiting, fault injection, timeout settings, retry mechanisms, etc. These features help applications achieve higher-level load balancing, fault tolerance, and reliability requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to ArgoCD and Kubernetes Deployment objects, Istio provides the following advantages in application deployment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fine-grained traffic routing control&lt;/strong&gt;: Istio provides richer traffic routing capabilities, enabling flexible routing and distribution based on a variety of request attributes, allowing for finer-grained traffic control and management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced release policy support&lt;/strong&gt;: Istio&amp;rsquo;s DestinationRule can specify traffic weights between different versions of service instances, supporting advanced application release policies such as canary release and blue-green deployment. This makes version management and release of applications more flexible and controllable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powerful traffic control and policy capabilities&lt;/strong&gt;: Istio provides rich traffic control and policy capabilities such as traffic limiting, fault injection, timeout settings, retry mechanisms, etc. These features help applications achieve higher-level load balancing, fault tolerance, and reliability requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining Istio with Argo Rollouts can fully leverage the advantages of Istio&amp;rsquo;s fine-grained traffic routing. Let&amp;rsquo;s now have a demo together. In our demo, we will use the Kubernetes and Istio environments provided by TSE, implement GitOps using ArgoCD, and implement canary release using Argo Rollouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;demo&#34;&gt;Demo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software versions used in our demo are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes v1.24.14&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Istio v1.15.7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ArgoCD v2.7.4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Argo Rollouts v1.5.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TSE Preview2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use Istio&amp;rsquo;s VirtualService and DestinationRule to implement traffic grouping routing based on Subset, and use ArgoCD Rollouts for progressive release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deploy-argocd-and-argo-rollouts&#34;&gt;Deploy ArgoCD and Argo Rollouts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have created a Kubernetes cluster and added it to TSE in advance, and TSE will automatically install Istio control plane for the cluster. We also need to install ArgoCD and Argo Rollouts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Install ArgoCD&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;kubectl create namespace argocd
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Install ArgoCD CLI on macOS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;brew install argocd
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Change the service type of argocd-server to LoadBalancer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;kubectl patch svc argocd-server -n argocd -p &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;{&amp;#34;spec&amp;#34;: {&amp;#34;type&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;LoadBalancer&amp;#34;}}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Get the ArgoCD UI address&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;ARGOCD_ADDR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;kubectl get svc argocd-server -n argocd -o &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;jsonpath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Login using ArgoCD CLI, see https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/#4-login-using-the-cli to get password&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;argocd login &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$ARGOCD_ADDR&lt;/span&gt; --skip-test-tls --grpc-web --insecure
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Install Argo Rollouts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;kubectl create namespace argo-rollouts
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;kubectl apply -n argo-rollouts -f https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/releases/download/latest/install.yaml
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Install rollouts plugin on macOS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;curl -LO https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/releases/download/v1.5.0/kubectl-argo-rollouts-darwin-amd64
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;chmod +x ./kubectl-argo-rollouts-darwin-amd64
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sudo mv ./kubectl-argo-rollouts-darwin-amd64 /usr/local/bin/kubectl-argo-rollouts
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This feature is not applicable to TSE Bridge Mode, so we will use TSE Direct Mode to achieve progressive release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert&#34;&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert-note-title py-1 px-2&#34;&gt;
  💡 What is Bridge Mode and Direct Mode?
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert-note py-1 px-2&#34;&gt;
  Direct Mode and Bridge Mode are two modes in TSE for control plane to issue configuration. They are suitable for flow, security, and gateway group configuration modes. BRIDGED mode is a minimalist mode that allows users to quickly configure the most commonly used features in the service mesh using Tetrate-specific APIs, while DIRECT mode provides greater flexibility for advanced users, allowing them to configure using Istio APIs directly.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, deploy Rollouts Dashboard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;git clone https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts.git
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;kustomize build manifests/dashboard-install&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;kubectl apply -n argo-rollouts -f -
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;kubectl port-forward svc/argo-rollouts-dashboard -n argo-rollouts 3100:3100
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can now access the Rollouts Dashboard at &lt;a href=&#34;https://localhost:3100/rollouts/&#34; title=&#34;https://localhost:3100/rollouts/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://localhost:3100/rollouts/&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deploy-bookinfo-application&#34;&gt;Deploy Bookinfo Application&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have prepared the configuration file for the Bookinfo application (saved in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tetrateio/tse-gitops-demo/&#34; title=&#34;tse-gitops-demo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;tse-gitops-demo&lt;/a&gt;
 repository), and you can also fork it to your own account and replace it with your own repository. Run the following command to deploy the Bookinfo application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;argocd app create bookinfo-app --repo https://github.com/tetrateio/tse-gitops-demo.git --path application --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc --dest-namespace bookinfo --sync-policy automated
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: We set &lt;code&gt;replicas&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tetrateio/tse-gitops-demo/blob/main/application/bookinfo.yaml#L151&#34; title=&#34;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;reviews&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Deployment&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;reviews&lt;/code&gt; Deployment&lt;/a&gt;
 because we will create Argo Rollouts to manipulate the number of instances of the &lt;code&gt;reviews&lt;/code&gt; service. If you set it to a non-zero positive integer here, we will not be able to achieve canary deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can open the ArgoCD UI in your browser, as shown in Figure 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/implementing-gitops-and-canary-deployment-with-argo-project-and-istio/f4.png&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/implementing-gitops-and-canary-deployment-with-argo-project-and-istio/f4.png&#34; data-width=&#34;3836&#34; data-height=&#34;1928&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 4: ArgoCD UI&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 4: ArgoCD UI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find that the application status is not in sync, you can run the following command or click the SYNC button in the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;argocd app sync bookinfo-app
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;implementing-fine-grained-traffic-management-with-istio&#34;&gt;Implementing Fine-grained Traffic Management with Istio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;rsquo;s use Argo CD to create Istio-related resource objects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;argocd app create bookinfo-tse-conf --repo https://github.com/tetrateio/tse-gitops-demo.git --path argo/tse --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc --dest-namespace bookinfo --sync-policy automated --self-heal
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Check the creation status&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;argocd app get bookinfo-tse-conf
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;converting-deployment-to-rollout&#34;&gt;Converting Deployment to Rollout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we want to release a new version of the &lt;code&gt;reviews&lt;/code&gt; service. To achieve zero downtime updates, we will use canary deployment, with the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce the &lt;code&gt;replicas&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;reviews&lt;/code&gt; Deployment to 0;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a Rollout that references the &lt;code&gt;reviews&lt;/code&gt; Deployment previously deployed in the Bookinfo application;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send traffic to the &lt;code&gt;reviews&lt;/code&gt; service to achieve automatic canary deployment progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can view the Rollout and AnalysisTemplate configurations used in this demo on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tetrateio/tse-gitops-demo/tree/main/argo/rollout&#34; title=&#34;GitHub&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;
. Run the following command to deploy &lt;code&gt;reivews-rollout&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;argocd app create reviews-rollout --repo https://github.com/tetrateio/tse-gitops-demo.git --path argo/rollout --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc --dest-namespace bookinfo --sync-policy automated
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: We can use the &lt;code&gt;argocd&lt;/code&gt; command to deploy or use &lt;code&gt;kubectl apply&lt;/code&gt;. It is recommended to use &lt;code&gt;argocd&lt;/code&gt; because you can view the deployment status in ArgoCD UI and Argo Rollouts Dashboard at the same time and manage the deployment using the &lt;code&gt;argocd&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View the status of the &lt;code&gt;reviews&lt;/code&gt; rollouts in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://localhost:3001/rollouts/bookinfo&#34; title=&#34;Argo Rollouts Dashboard&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Argo Rollouts Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;
, and use the following command to send traffic to the &lt;code&gt;reviews&lt;/code&gt; service for a period of time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;GATEWAY_HOSTNAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;kubectl -n bookinfo get service tsb-gateway-bookinfo -o &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;jsonpath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; 1&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; curl -H &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Host: bookinfo.tetrate.com&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; http://&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$GATEWAY_HOSTNAME&lt;/span&gt;/api/v1/products/1/reviews&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;sleep 3&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will see responses from pods with different rollouts-pod-template-hash labels in the output, which proves that canary deployment is effective. After about 10 minutes, the Argo Rollouts Dashboard you see will be as shown in Figure 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/implementing-gitops-and-canary-deployment-with-argo-project-and-istio/f5.png&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/implementing-gitops-and-canary-deployment-with-argo-project-and-istio/f5.png&#34; data-width=&#34;3584&#34; data-height=&#34;2240&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 5: Argo Rollout Dashboard&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 5: Argo Rollout Dashboard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Figure 5, we can see that canary deployment is progressing smoothly and has reached the third step. This is because the &lt;code&gt;apdex&lt;/code&gt; (Application Performance Index) indicator of the &lt;code&gt;reviews&lt;/code&gt; service is normal. You can use &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetrate.io/blog/how-to-use-graphql-to-query-observability-data-from-skywalking-with-postman/&#34; title=&#34;Postman to submit GraphQL queries to SkyWalking&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Postman to submit GraphQL queries to SkyWalking&lt;/a&gt;
 to verify this, as shown in Figure 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/implementing-gitops-and-canary-deployment-with-argo-project-and-istio/f6.png&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/implementing-gitops-and-canary-deployment-with-argo-project-and-istio/f6.png&#34; data-width=&#34;3584&#34; data-height=&#34;2040&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 6: Submitting GraphQL queries to SkyWalking using Postman&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 6: Submitting GraphQL queries to SkyWalking using Postman&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GraphQL query statement we built is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

You can also click Promote manually on the Argo Rollouts Dashboard to promote it, or run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;principles-of-argo-rollouts&#34;&gt;Principles of Argo Rollouts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When integrating with Istio, Argo Rollouts supports traffic splitting based on VirtualService and Subset, as shown in Figure 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/implementing-gitops-and-canary-deployment-with-argo-project-and-istio/f7.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/implementing-gitops-and-canary-deployment-with-argo-project-and-istio/f7.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 7: Argo Rollouts uses Istio for traffic splitting&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 7: Argo Rollouts uses Istio for traffic splitting&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table below provides a detailed comparison of these two traffic segmentation methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Applicable Scenario&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Resource Object&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Principle&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Host-level Traffic Split&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Applicable for accessing different versions of services based on hostname;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2 Services, 1 VirtualService, 1 Rollout;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rollout injects the rollouts-pod-template-hash label into the ReplicaSet and selects pods with these labels by updating the selector in the Service;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Subset-level Traffic Split&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Applicable for accessing different services based on labels;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 Service, 1 VirtualService, 1 DestinationRule, and 1 Rollout;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rollout injects the rollouts-pod-template-hash label into the ReplicaSet and selects pods with these labels by updating the selector in the DestinationRule;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subset-based traffic splitting is used in this demo, and Argo Rollouts continuously:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;modify the VirtualService &lt;code&gt;spec.http[].route[].weight&lt;/code&gt; to match the current desired canary weight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;modify the DestinationRule &lt;code&gt;spec.subsets[].labels&lt;/code&gt; to contain the &lt;code&gt;rollouts-pod-template-hash&lt;/code&gt; label of the canary and stable ReplicaSets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article introduces how to use the Argo project and Istio to achieve GitOps and canary deployment. First, we use ArgoCD to achieve GitOps, and then use Argo Rollout and SkyWalking to achieve automated canary release. From the demo, we can see that the Istio deployed by TSE is fully compatible with the open-source version. There are many features of TSE worth exploring, visit the &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetrate.io/tetrate-service-express/&#34; title=&#34;Tetrate website&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tetrate website&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;In this article, I will explain how to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://graphql.org/&#34; title=&#34;GraphQL&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GraphQL&lt;/a&gt;
 to query data from &lt;a href=&#34;https://skywalking.apache.org/&#34; title=&#34;SkyWalking&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SkyWalking&lt;/a&gt;
 with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.postman.com/&#34; title=&#34;Postman&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Postman&lt;/a&gt;
. It includes steps to obtain the bearer token, construct a query to retrieve load metrics for a specific service, and use GraphQL introspection to see the schema of SkyWalking GraphQL APIs. The article also provides references for further information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-graphql&#34;&gt;What Is GraphQL?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs developed by Facebook. It provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to traditional REST APIs by allowing clients to specify exactly what data they need and receive only that data in response. With GraphQL, clients can query multiple resources in a single request, reducing the number of roundtrips to the server and improving performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-the-difference-between-graphql-and-rest-apis&#34;&gt;What’s the Difference between GraphQL and REST APIs?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need, while REST APIs require clients to retrieve everything in a resource regardless of whether they need it or not. Additionally, GraphQL allows clients to query multiple resources in a single request, making it more efficient and less chatty than REST APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-i-query-data-from-skywalking&#34;&gt;How Do I Query Data from SkyWalking?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SkyWalking defines the communication protocol for the query stage. The SkyWalking native UI and CLI use this protocol to consistently fetch data from the backend, without needing to worry about backend updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two methods for querying metrics from SkyWalking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://skywalking.apache.org/docs/main/v9.4.0/en/api/query-protocol/&#34; title=&#34;GraphQL APIs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GraphQL APIs&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://skywalking.apache.org/docs/main/v9.4.0/en/api/promql-service/&#34; title=&#34;PromQL APIs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;PromQL APIs&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article provides a guide on how to use GraphQL to query metrics from SkyWalking. If you are interested in the PromQL APIs, you can refer to the article&lt;a href=&#34;https://skywalking.apache.org/blog/2023-03-17-build-grafana-dashboards-for-apache-skywalking-native-promql-support/&#34; title=&#34; Build Grafana dashboards for Apache SkyWalking — Native PromQL Support&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt; Build Grafana dashboards for Apache SkyWalking — Native PromQL Support&lt;/a&gt;
.Continuing with the following steps requires a TSB installation. If you don’t have one and still want to experience using GraphQL to query data in SkyWalking, you can use the free&lt;a href=&#34;https://skywalking.apache.org/&#34; title=&#34; demo environment&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt; demo environment&lt;/a&gt;
 (username/password: skywalking/skywalking) provided by SkyWalking. Log in to the demo website and get a token for queries. Endpoint address for GraphQL queries is&lt;a href=&#34;http://demo.skywalking.apache.org/graphql&#34; title=&#34; http://demo.skywalking.apache.org/graphql&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt; http://demo.skywalking.apache.org/graphql&lt;/a&gt;
. The steps to construct the query are the same as described below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;observe-graphql-queries-in-tsb&#34;&gt;Observe GraphQL Queries in TSB&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we use Postman to construct our own GraphQL query, let’s first observe how TSB obtains data from SkyWalking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Chrome DevTools and switch to the Network tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit the &lt;strong&gt;Organization – Services&lt;/strong&gt; tab on the website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch the network request list and right-click on the one of the graphql requests, like in the following image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The curl commands you see will look like this. Execute the command in your terminal, and you will get a list of services managed by TSB from SkyWalking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;curl &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;lt;https://saturn.tetrate.work/ui/graphql&amp;gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  -H &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Accept-Language: en,zh-CN;q=0.9,zh;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.7,zh-TW;q=0.6&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  -H &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Referer: &amp;lt;https://saturn.tetrate.work/mp/services&amp;gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  -H &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  -H &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  -H &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;sec-ch-ua-platform: &amp;#34;macOS&amp;#34;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  --data-raw &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;$&amp;#39;{&amp;#34;query&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;query ServiceRegistryListMetrics(...)}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  --compressed
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Some fields in the above example are too long and replaced with dots (…)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I will guide you through constructing a query to retrieve the load metrics for a specific service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obtain-the-bearer-token&#34;&gt;Obtain the Bearer Token&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, you need to obtain the bearer of the website. Log in to TSB UI, click on the user button in the upper right corner, and then click “Show token information”. In the pop-up window, you will see the Bearer Token, as shown in the following image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/how-to-use-graphql-to-query-observability-data-from-skywalking-with-postman/f2.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/how-to-use-graphql-to-query-observability-data-from-skywalking-with-postman/f2.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;2046&#34; data-height=&#34;1036&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 2: Get the bearer token from the TSB UI&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 2: Get the bearer token from the TSB UI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The validity period of the bearer token is relatively short. When it expires, you need to log in to TSB again to obtain a new token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already deployed the&lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/examples/bookinfo/&#34; title=&#34; bookinfo application&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt; bookinfo application&lt;/a&gt;
 in advance and sent some test traffic. To query the load metrics of reviews using GraphQL in the Postman client, follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new GraphQL request and enter the request URL: &lt;code&gt;$TSB_ADDRESS/graphql&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the &lt;code&gt;Authorization&lt;/code&gt; header with the value&lt;code&gt; Bearer $TOKEN&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use GraphQL Introspection to see the schema of SkyWalking GraphQL APIs. Find and click the &lt;code&gt;readMetricsValues&lt;/code&gt; item. You will see the variables on the right side. Fill in the &lt;code&gt;condition&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;duration&lt;/code&gt; items, as shown in the following image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/how-to-use-graphql-to-query-observability-data-from-skywalking-with-postman/f3.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/how-to-use-graphql-to-query-observability-data-from-skywalking-with-postman/f3.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;2048&#34; data-height=&#34;1164&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 3: Postman query&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 3: Postman query&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variables look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-graphql&#34; data-lang=&#34;graphql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nc&#34;&gt;ReadMetricsValues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above is using the SkyWalking Demo environment to test GraphQL queries. GraphQL query support is also provided in TSE, and the endpoint address is &lt;code&gt;https://$TSB_SERVER/graphql&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The query endpoint here is different from what we see in DevTool. The GraphQL query endpoint specific to the TSB UI is &lt;code&gt;https://$TSB_SERVER/ui/graphql&lt;/code&gt;.For details about the SkyWalking GraphQL Query Protocol, please refer to&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apache/skywalking-query-protocol/tree/master&#34; title=&#34; GitHub&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt; GitHub&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I have introduced how to use the GraphQL query protocol in Postman to query data in SkyWalking. You can construct your own query conditions based on the GraphQL schema of SkyWalking. This feature is also available in TSB/TSE.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;In June, &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.18.x/announcing-1.18/&#34; title=&#34;Istio 1.18 was released&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio 1.18 was released&lt;/a&gt;
, marking the second release of Istio in 2023 and the first to offer official support for &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetrate.io/blog/istio-ambient-mesh-merged-to-main/&#34; title=&#34;ambient mode&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ambient mode&lt;/a&gt;
. Tetrate’s Paul Merrison was one of the release managers for this version, and Tetrate’s contributions to this release included various customer-driven usability enhancements and important work in the underlying Envoy Proxy upon which Istio depends. When asked about the experience of working on Istio 1.18, Paul said “working as the lead release manager for Istio 1.18 gave me a fascinating insight into how a group of super talented people from around the world come together, organize themselves and ship software. There was a steep learning curve, but the Istio community is awesome and I was supported brilliantly. The biggest challenge was definitely learning and executing all the steps that are needed to bring a release to life, but the feeling of achievement when it finally made its way out into the world will stay with me for a while!” Istio first announced the introduction of Ambient mode in September last year, which was covered in detail by Zack in&lt;a href=&#34;https://tetrate.io/blog/ambient-mesh-what-you-need-to-know-about-this-experimental-new-deployment-model-for-istio/&#34; title=&#34; this blog post&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt; this blog post&lt;/a&gt;
, where he explains the differences between ambient mode and sidecar mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release introduces many &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.18.x/announcing-1.18/change-notes/&#34; title=&#34;new features and changes&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;new features and changes&lt;/a&gt;
 in addition to ambient mode, including enhanced Kubernetes Gateway API support, health checks for virtual machines that are not automatically registered, support for expired metrics, enhanced &lt;code&gt;istioctl analyze&lt;/code&gt;, and more. See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.18.x/announcing-1.18/&#34; title=&#34;release blog&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;release blog&lt;/a&gt;
 for details. The most significant of these are the ambient mode and Gateway API enhancements, detailed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-ambient-mode&#34;&gt;What Is Ambient Mode?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before discussing ambient mode, it is essential to understand the current “sidecar mode” used by Istio. Sidecar mode is the default data plane mode used by Istio, where each application pod comes equipped with a sidecar proxy (usually Envoy) that handles all network traffic in and out of the pod, providing Istio’s core functionality such as Zero Trust security, telemetry and traffic management. While sidecar mode is suitable for most users, ambient mode offers some advantages in specific circumstances. For more information on the differences between ambient mode and the standard sidecar mode, see&lt;a href=&#34;https://tetrate.io/blog/ambient-mesh-what-you-need-to-know-about-this-experimental-new-deployment-model-for-istio/&#34; title=&#34; our article on Ambient Mesh: What You Need to Know about This Experimental New Deployment Model for Istio&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt; our article on Ambient Mesh: What You Need to Know about This Experimental New Deployment Model for Istio&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-the-design-goals-of-ambient-mode&#34;&gt;What Are the Design Goals of Ambient Mode?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-intrusive&lt;/strong&gt;: Ambient mode does not require injecting sidecar proxies into the application’s pods and only requires the application to be tagged to automatically join the mesh, potentially reducing the mesh’s impact on the application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficient resource utilization&lt;/strong&gt;: Ambient mode can optimize resource utilization for some use cases by sharing the ztunnel proxy across the mesh. If certain L7 functionality of Istio is required, it can also be addressed by deploying Waypoints precisely for a ServiceAccount or Namespace, providing more control over resource consumption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance parity with sidecar mode&lt;/strong&gt;: Ambient mode initially adopted a shared proxy model based on Envoy, but during development, issues such as complex Envoy configuration were discovered, leading the Istio community to develop its shared proxy (&lt;a href=&#34;https://tetrate.io/blog/using-geneve-tunnels-to-implement-istio-ambient-mesh-traffic-interception/&#34; title=&#34;ztunnel&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ztunnel&lt;/a&gt;
) based on Rust. In the future, ambient mode is expected to have comparable performance to traditional sidecar mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt;: Ambient mode provides TLS support by running a shared proxy ztunnel on each node, and when users require the same security as sidecar mode, they also need to deploy one or more Waypoints in each namespace to handle L7 traffic in that namespace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can use &lt;code&gt;istioctl x waypoint&lt;/code&gt; for Waypoint configuration management. For example, running the &lt;code&gt;istioctl x waypoint generate&lt;/code&gt; command generates a Kubernetes Gateway API resource managed by Istio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, ambient mode promises to offer additional flexibility to Istio’s deployment model which may prove helpful to some users. It should be noted that the ambient mode is still in the &lt;strong&gt;alpha stage&lt;/strong&gt; and has yet to achieve production-level stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;enhanced-kubernetes-gateway-api-support&#34;&gt;Enhanced Kubernetes Gateway API Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istio 1.18 introduces several vital improvements and modifications to its Kubernetes Gateway API support:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for v1beta1&lt;/strong&gt;: When upgrading to the new version of Istio, Gateway API version greater than 0.6.0+ is required. Use the &lt;code&gt;istioctl x precheck &lt;/code&gt;command to check for upgrade issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gateway API automated deployment management upgrades&lt;/strong&gt;: All Kubernetes Gateway resources Istio manages will automatically configure Service and Deployment resources when created or updated. If the Gateway resource changes, the associated configuration will also be updated synchronously. In addition, the deployment of Gateway resources no longer depends on injection logic but has an independent creation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Removal of support for the &lt;code&gt;proxy.istio.io/config&lt;/code&gt; annotation&lt;/strong&gt;: The ProxyConfig resource only affects the Istio-managed Gateway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixes to Istiod handling of configuration changes&lt;/strong&gt;: If Service and Deployment configurations change, Istiod reprocesses them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It no longer supports the Alpha version of the Gateway API by default&lt;/strong&gt;: It can be re-enabled by setting &lt;code&gt;PILOT_ENABLE_ALPHA_GATEWAY_API=true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that when installing ambient mode, unlike previous Istio installations, IngressGateway is no longer included by default. In future development, Istio is leaning towards using the Gateway API to manage gateways. For more information on why the Gateway API is recommended over Ingress, please read&lt;a href=&#34;https://tetrate.io/blog/why-the-gateway-api-is-the-unified-future-of-ingress-for-kubernetes-and-service-mesh/&#34; title=&#34; my previous blog article on why the Gateway API Is the unified future of ingress for Kubernetes and service mesh&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt; my previous blog article on why the Gateway API Is the unified future of ingress for Kubernetes and service mesh&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re excited that ambient mode is now available to users in an official Istio release, especially as it promises to make mesh adoption easier for all users.

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;In a previous&lt;a href=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/ambient-mesh-l7-traffic-path/&#34; title=&#34; blog post&#34;&gt; blog post&lt;/a&gt;
, I discussed how Istio Ambient Mesh uses iptables and Geneve tunnels to intercept traffic from application pods into Ztunnel. Many readers may not be familiar with this tunneling protocol, so this article will introduce the definition, packet structure and advantages of Geneve tunnels compared with the VXLAN protocol. Finally, this article will introduce how Istio Ambient Mesh applies Geneve tunnels to implement traffic interception and the new eBPF mode introduced in Istio 1.18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-to-geneve-tunnels&#34;&gt;Introduction to Geneve Tunnels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to address the lack of flexibility and security in current data transmissions, the Geneve (Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation) network virtualization encapsulation (tunneling) protocol was created. Geneve only defines a data encapsulation format, excluding control plane information. The key advantage of Geneve over VXLAN encapsulation is that it extends the types of encapsulated protocols by adding TLV format options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;geneve-vs-vxlan&#34;&gt;Geneve vs. VXLAN&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VXLAN and Geneve are both network virtualization protocols and they have many similarities. Virtualization protocols are technologies that separate virtual networks from physical networks. They allow network administrators to create multiple virtual networks in a virtual environment, each of which can have its own VLAN identifiers, IP addresses and routing. In addition, VXLAN and Geneve use UDP encapsulation, which enables them to be extended through existing network infrastructure. VXLAN and Geneve protocols are also flexible, can be used in different network topologies and are compatible with different virtualization platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 shows the message structure of VXLAN and Geneve tunnels and the differences in their respective headers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/traffic-interception-with-geneve-tunnel-with-istio-ambient-mesh/vxlan-vs-geneve.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/traffic-interception-with-geneve-tunnel-with-istio-ambient-mesh/vxlan-vs-geneve.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 1: VXLAN and Geneve packet format schematic diagram.&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 1: VXLAN and Geneve packet format schematic diagram.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the figure, we can see that the message structure of VXLAN and Geneve tunneling protocols is similar, with the main difference being the use of different UDP port numbers and protocol headers. VXLAN uses port 4789, while Geneve uses port 6081. The Geneve protocol header is more extendable than VXLAN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Geneve tunneling protocol adds variable-length options that can contain zero or more option data in TLV format, making it more scalable than VXLAN. TLV stands for Type-Length-Value, which is a format for parsing and transmitting metadata in network packets. Each metadata information in the Geneve protocol is composed of a TLV format field, making it simple to flexibly add, delete and modify these metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TLV format field contains the following data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type: 8-bit type field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Length: 5-bit option length field, represented in multiples of 4 bytes, excluding the option header.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data: Variable-length option data field, which may not exist or may be between 4 and 128 bytes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Geneve protocol can easily modify and extend metadata information while maintaining compatibility and flexibility by using the TLV format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please refer to&lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7348&#34; title=&#34; RFC 7348 Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN): A Framework for Overlaying Virtualized Layer 2 Networks over Layer 3 Networks&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt; RFC 7348 Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN): A Framework for Overlaying Virtualized Layer 2 Networks over Layer 3 Networks&lt;/a&gt;
 for more information about VXLAN. For more information about the Geneve tunnel packet format, please refer to&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8926#name-geneve-packet-format-over-i&#34; title=&#34; RFC 8926 Geneve: Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt; RFC 8926 Geneve: Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-it-works&#34;&gt;How it Works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Geneve tunnel is mainly used in cloud computing and virtualization scenarios, and it can encapsulate packets in a new packet for transmission in a virtual network. The Geneve tunnel uses a 24-bit VNI (Virtual Network Identifier) to transmit packets from one physical network to another. The Geneve tunnel can also use security protocols such as IPsec and TLS to protect the transmission of packets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a packet reaches the destination host, the Geneve tunnel protocol will de-encapsulate the packet from the Geneve protocol header and deliver it to the destination in the virtual network. During the de-encapsulation process, the VNI information in the Geneve protocol header is used to determine the destination of the packet, ensuring that the packet is correctly routed to the destination in the virtual network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming there is a virtual network with a VNI of 1001. When a packet is transmitted from one physical network to another, a tunnel can be used to track the packet during transmission by setting the VNI between the source and target physical networks to 1001. When the packet reaches the target physical network, the VNI is removed from the packet and the packet is delivered to the target physical network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;security&#34;&gt;Security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Geneve tunnel protocol itself does not provide any security mechanisms, so packets transmitted in the Geneve tunnel can be subject to threats such as packet tampering, interception and replay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure the security of packets transmitted in the Geneve tunnel, some security protocols can be used. The following are some common security protocols:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IPsec (Internet Protocol Security): IPsec is a network layer security protocol that can encrypt, authenticate and provide integrity protection to packets in the Geneve tunnel. IPsec can provide end-to-end security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TLS (Transport Layer Security): TLS is an encryption protocol based on the transport layer that can encrypt and authenticate packets in the Geneve tunnel. TLS can provide end-to-end security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MACSec (Media Access Control Security): MACSec is a data link layer security protocol that can encrypt and authenticate packets in the Geneve tunnel. MACSec can provide link-layer security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the above security protocols require corresponding configuration and deployment and may have a certain impact on performance. When choosing the appropriate security protocol, factors such as security, performance, manageability and other aspects need to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-choose-geneve&#34;&gt;Why Choose Geneve?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following table compares the characteristics of VXLAN and Geneve in multiple aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Performance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Shorter header, higher performance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Longer header, slightly lower performance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table 1:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;VXLAN vs Geneve characteristics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason for using the Geneve protocol is to combine the advantages of current network virtualization encapsulation technologies (such as VXLAN, NVGRE and STT) into one protocol. Through years of network virtualization development experience, we know that one of the most important requirements is scalability. The Geneve protocol encodes metadata using an extensible TLV structure, so it can independently develop the functionality of software and hardware endpoints to meet growing needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-istio-ambient-mesh-applies-geneve-tunnels&#34;&gt;How Istio Ambient Mesh Applies Geneve Tunnels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the&lt;a href=&#34;https://tetrate.io/blog/transparent-traffic-intercepting-and-routing-in-the-l4-network-of-istio-ambient-mesh/&#34; title=&#34; previous blog&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt; previous blog&lt;/a&gt;
, I explained how Istio Ambient Mesh uses Ztunnel to implement L4 proxies and Figure 2 shows the L4 transparent traffic interception path using iptables and Geneve tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/traffic-interception-with-geneve-tunnel-with-istio-ambient-mesh/geneve-tunnel.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/traffic-interception-with-geneve-tunnel-with-istio-ambient-mesh/geneve-tunnel.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 2: L4 Transparent Traffic Interception Path Using Iptables and Geneve Tunnels.&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 2: L4 Transparent Traffic Interception Path Using Iptables and Geneve Tunnels.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

From the figure, we can see that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Istio CNI creates an &lt;code&gt;istioout&lt;/code&gt; network card and iptables rules on the node, transparently intercepting the outbound traffic in the node to the &lt;code&gt;pistioout&lt;/code&gt; virtual network card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Istio CNI creates an &lt;code&gt;istioin&lt;/code&gt; network card and iptables rules on the node, transparently intercepting the inbound traffic in the node to the &lt;code&gt;pistioin&lt;/code&gt; virtual network card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Istio CNI creates &lt;code&gt;pistioin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pistioout&lt;/code&gt; network cards in ztunnel to receive data packets in the Geneve tunnel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two network cards &lt;code&gt;pistioin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pistioout&lt;/code&gt; are created by the init container or Istio CNI (see the &lt;code&gt;CreateRulesWithinNodeProxyNS&lt;/code&gt; function in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/istio/istio/blob/master/cni/pkg/ambient/net_linux.go#L910&#34; title=&#34;net_linux.go&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;net_linux.go&lt;/a&gt;
), and their IP addresses and ports are fixed. The data packets sent by the application container need to pass through the &lt;code&gt;istioout&lt;/code&gt; network card and be forwarded to the ztunnel container after being encapsulated in the Geneve tunnel. When the data packets are received by the ztunnel container, they are de-encapsulated and forwarded to the corresponding application containers through the &lt;code&gt;pistioin&lt;/code&gt; network card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-ebpf-for-transparent-traffic-interception&#34;&gt;Using eBPF for Transparent Traffic Interception&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is a powerful technology that allows secure user-space programs to run within the Linux kernel. Initially developed as a technique for filtering network packets, eBPF has now been extended to other areas such as tracking system calls, performance analysis and security monitoring. The advantages of eBPF are its lightweight nature, efficiency, security and programmability. It can be used in real-time monitoring, network security, application debugging and optimization, container networking and various other fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istio Ambient Mesh also supports using the eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) mode for transparent traffic interception since 1.18. As shown in Figure 3, the eBPF program runs directly in the host kernel and forwards application traffic to ztunnel. Compared to the iptables-based approach, the eBPF mode can provide better network efficiency and scalability. However, it requires a higher version of the Linux kernel and is more difficult to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 3: Intercepting the Traffic of Application Using eBPF.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use the eBPF mode to run Ambient Mesh, simply set the &lt;code&gt;values.cni.ambient.redirectMode&lt;/code&gt; parameter to “ebpf” when installing Istio, as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;istioctl install --set &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;ambient --set values.cni.ambient.redirectMode&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;ebpf&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article introduced the working principle, security and comparison with VXLAN of the Geneve tunnel protocol. In addition, it also introduced how Istio Ambient Mesh uses Geneve tunnels to implement traffic interception and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of using eBPF for transparent traffic interception. The Geneve tunnel protocol is a universal tunneling protocol that can transmit packets in virtual networks, and it has more advantages than other tunneling protocols. Therefore, when choosing a tunneling protocol, users can consider using the Geneve tunnel. In Istio 1.18, the eBPF mode of Ambient Mesh is newly introduced, which can provide better network efficiency, but has higher requirements for the Linux kernel version. Users can choose according to their actual situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to service mesh and Kubernetes security, we have a bunch of free online courses &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetr8.io/academy&#34; title=&#34;available at Tetrate Academy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;available at Tetrate Academy&lt;/a&gt;
 that will quickly get you up to speed with Istio and Envoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a fast way to get to production with Istio, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetr8.io/tid&#34; title=&#34;Tetrate Istio Distribution (TID)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tetrate Istio Distribution (TID)&lt;/a&gt;
 . TID is Tetrate’s hardened, fully upstream Istio distribution, with FIPS-verified builds and support available. It’s a great way to get started with Istio knowing you have a trusted distribution to begin with, have an expert team supporting you, and also have the option to get to FIPS compliance quickly if you need to.Once you have Istio up and running, you will probably need simpler ways to manage and secure your services beyond what’s available in Istio, that’s where Tetrate Service Bridge comes in. You can learn more about how Tetrate Service Bridge makes service mesh more secure, manageable, and resilient &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetr8.io/tsb&#34; title=&#34;here&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Managing Certificates in Istio with cert-manager and SPIRE</title>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-certificates-management/&#34; title=&#34;the previous blog post&#34;&gt;the previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;
, I introduced how Istio manages certificates, and in this article, I will guide you on how to use an external certificate authority (CA) to achieve fine-grained certificate management and automatic certificate rotation through the integration of &lt;a href=&#34;https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/spire-about/spire-concepts/&#34; title=&#34;SPIRE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SPIRE&lt;/a&gt;
 and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cert-manager.io/&#34; title=&#34;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;cert-manager&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;cert-manager&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with SPIRE and what it’s used for, we recommend reading the following articles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tetrate.io/blog/why-would-you-need-spire-for-authentication-with-istio/&#34; title=&#34;Why Would You Need SPIRE for Authentication with Istio?&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Why Would You Need SPIRE for Authentication with Istio?&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/integrations/spire/&#34; title=&#34;How to integrate SPIRE in Istio&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;How to integrate SPIRE in Istio&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-to-the-certificate-issuance-and-management-process&#34;&gt;Introduction to the Certificate Issuance and Management Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 shows the certificate trust chain used in this article based on &lt;em&gt;cert-manager&lt;/em&gt; and SPIRE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/cert-manager-spire-istio/tree.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/cert-manager-spire-istio/tree.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 1: Certificate trust chain based on cert-manager and SPIRE.&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 1: Certificate trust chain based on cert-manager and SPIRE.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;cert-manager&lt;/em&gt; acts as the root CA to issue certificates to &lt;em&gt;istiod&lt;/em&gt; and SPIRE. We use a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/selfsigned/&#34; title=&#34;self-signed issuer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;self-signed issuer&lt;/a&gt;
, but you can also configure it to use built-in issuers such as Let’s Encrypt, Vault, Venafi, or other external issuers. You can also choose to use other &lt;a href=&#34;https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/deploying/spire_server/&#34; title=&#34;UpstreamAuthorities&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;UpstreamAuthorities&lt;/a&gt;
, such as Vault, SPIRE Federation, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SPIRE issues SVID certificates to the workloads and ingress Gateway and egress Gateway in the Istio mesh for mTLS between services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The certificates used when accessing the ingress Gateway from outside the mesh and when the egress Gateway access services outside the mesh need to be configured separately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 shows the certificate issuance and update process after integrating SPIRE and &lt;em&gt;cert-manager&lt;/em&gt; in Istio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/cert-manager-spire-istio/steps.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/cert-manager-spire-istio/steps.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 2: Certificate issuance and update process after integrating SPIRE and &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;cert-manager&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; in Istio.&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 2: Certificate issuance and update process after integrating SPIRE and &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;cert-manager&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; in Istio.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kubernetes Workload Registrar in the SPIRE Server automatically registers the workloads in Kubernetes and generates SPIFFE standard identities for all workloads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;cert-manager&lt;/em&gt; issues and manages the CA certificates for &lt;em&gt;istiod&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Envoy proxies in the workloads send certificate signing request (CSR) requests to the SPIRE Agent on the same node through the SDS API via a Unix domain socket (UDS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The SPIRE Agent sends the CSR to the SPIRE Server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The SPIRE Server returns the signed certificate to the SPIRE Agent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The SPIRE Agent returns the signed certificate to the workloads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SPIRE is responsible for the certificate management and updates for the workloads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a general understanding of the process, let’s install the components manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;install-cert-manager&#34;&gt;Install &lt;em&gt;cert-manager&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the following command to install &lt;em&gt;cert-manager&lt;/em&gt;, which we will use for automatic certificate rotation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.10.1/cert-manager.yaml
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The root CA is a self-signed certificate. Run the following command to configure the root CA:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;cat &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF | kubectl apply -f -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;cert-manager.io/v1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;Issuer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;selfsigned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;cert-manager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have installed &lt;em&gt;cert-manager&lt;/em&gt; and created a ClusterIssuer named &lt;em&gt;selfsigned-ca&lt;/em&gt;, let’s install SPIRE and use &lt;em&gt;cert-manager&lt;/em&gt; as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/spiffe/spire/blob/main/doc/plugin_server_upstreamauthority_cert_manager.md&#34; title=&#34;UpstreamAuthority&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;UpstreamAuthority&lt;/a&gt;
 for SPIRE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-spire&#34;&gt;Installing SPIRE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quickly install SPIRE by running the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;kubectl apply -f https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rootsongjc/5dac0518cc432cbf844114faca74aa40/raw/814587f94bbef8fb1dd376282249dcb2a8f7fa1b/spire-with-cert-manager-upstream-authority-quick-start.yaml
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This YAML file adapts to &lt;em&gt;cert-manager&lt;/em&gt; compared to the &lt;code&gt;samples/security/spire/spire-quickstart.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file in the Istio 1.16 installation package, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding permissions for the cert-manager.io API group to the spire-server-trust-role ClusterRole;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding an UpstreamAuthority “cert-manager” configuration in the SPIRE Server configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The trust_domain in the SPIRE Server configuration should be consistent with the &lt;strong&gt;TRUST_DOMAIN&lt;/strong&gt; environment variable specified when installing Istio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This command installs the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/spiffe/spire/blob/main/support/k8s/k8s-workload-registrar/README.md&#34; title=&#34;Kubernetes Workload Registrar&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Kubernetes Workload Registrar&lt;/a&gt;
, automatically registering the workloads in Kubernetes. All workloads will be registered with the SPIFFE standard service identity format &lt;code&gt;spiffe://&amp;lt;trust-domain&amp;gt;/ns/&amp;lt;namespace&amp;gt;/sa/&amp;lt;service-account&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; based on their service accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to adjust the TTL of the SPIRE CA and SVID certificates, you can modify ca_ttl (default 24h) and default_svid_ttl (default 1h) in the SPIRE Server configuration. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/deploying/spire_server/&#34; title=&#34;SPIRE Server configuration&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SPIRE Server configuration&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;install-istio&#34;&gt;Install Istio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the following command to install Istio and enable CA certificate rotation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;istioctl operator init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;istioctl install --skip-confirmation -f - &amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;install.istio.io/v1alpha1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;IstioOperator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;istioctl kube-inject -f bookinfo-with-spire-template.yaml &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; kubectl apply -f -
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: The &lt;code&gt;bookinfo-with-spire-template.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file used in the above command can be found in &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rootsongjc/5dac0518cc432cbf844114faca74aa40/raw/5f4ce4c857cfb9f45121b6e4d26d01b8d4e29b84/&#34; title=&#34;this Gist&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this Gist&lt;/a&gt;
, and the only difference with the *&lt;code&gt;samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file in the Istio installer is that the following annotation has been added to the template for each Deployment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;annotations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;inject.istio.io/templates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;sidecar,spire&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the following command to check whether SPIRE has issued an identity to the workload:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;kubectl &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt; -i -t spire-server-0 -n spire -c spire-server -- /bin/sh -c &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;bin/spire-server entry show -socketPath /run/spire/sockets/server.sock&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see the identity of the &lt;em&gt;productpage&lt;/em&gt; service in the output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open the &lt;em&gt;chain.pem&lt;/em&gt; file with a text editor, and you will see two certificates. Save the two certificates in separate files and use the &lt;em&gt;openssl&lt;/em&gt; command &lt;code&gt;openssl x509 -noout -text -in $FILE&lt;/code&gt; to parse the certificate contents, and you will see the certificate trust chain in Figure 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;istioctl proxy-config secret deployment/istiod -o json &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; jq -r &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the certificate trust chain, we can see that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;cert-manager&lt;/em&gt; acts as the root node of the PKI to issue certificates for &lt;em&gt;istiod&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SPIRE acts as an intermediate CA and then issues certificates for individual workloads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The URI in the X.509 v3 principal alias of the workloads in the Istio mesh follows the SPIFFE identity specification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;To modify the automatic rotation period for workload certificates, you can set the environment variable &lt;code&gt;**SECRET_TTL** &lt;/code&gt;of the pilot-agent command, which defaults to 24h0m0s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we used &lt;em&gt;cert-manager&lt;/em&gt; as the PKI, integrated SPIRE into our certificate chain of trust, and created identities and certificates for workloads in the Istio mesh. Using cert-manager means you don’t have to worry about istiod certificate expiration, and you can renew certificates as needed. You can also integrate cert-manager with certificate providers, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://letsencrypt.org/&#34; title=&#34;Let’s Encrypt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Let’s Encrypt&lt;/a&gt;

, etc. You can also use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cert-manager/istio-csr&#34; title=&#34;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;istio-csr&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;istio-csr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 to let the &lt;em&gt;cert-manager&lt;/em&gt; manage certificates in Istio directly. &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.tetratelabs.io/blog/external-ca-integration-with-cert-manager-using-istio-csr/&#34; title=&#34;Use &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;istio-csr&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; to integrate an external CA with a certificate manager&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Use &lt;em&gt;istio-csr&lt;/em&gt; to integrate an external CA with a certificate manager&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>How Are Certificates Managed in Istio?</title>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;I mentioned in &lt;a href=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/blog/understanding-the-tls-encryption-in-istio/&#34; title=&#34;my last article&#34;&gt;my last article&lt;/a&gt;
 on understanding mTLS traffic encryption in Istio that the key to traffic encryption is certificate management. We can use the built-in certificate authority (CA) in Istio or a custom CA to manage certificates within the mesh. This blog post will explain how Istio handles certificate management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-certificate&#34;&gt;What Is a Certificate?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many types of certificates, but in this article, I am explicitly referring to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280&#34; title=&#34;X.509 V3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;X.509 V3&lt;/a&gt;
 certificates. X.509 certificates are a standard digital format used to identify entities in computer networks. X.509 is the international standard for public key infrastructure (PKI) and is primarily used for identity authentication and information encryption, such as TLS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contents of a certificate are hashed using a hash function and then signed with the issuer’s private key. This way, when a certificate is received, the recipient can use the issuer’s public key to verify the certificate’s validity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hash function is a function that maps an input of any length (also called a message) to a fixed-length output, also called a &lt;em&gt;hash value&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;message digest&lt;/em&gt;. There are many hash functions, such as MD5, SHA-1, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A certificate is like a business card issued by an authoritative agency for the user to prove their identity, and it can also be used to encrypt information to ensure the security and integrity of communication. The following diagram shows the general steps of TLS communication, where the certificate proves the server’s identity and encrypts the communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 shows an example of an HTTP call to a website, issuing a digital certificate, authenticating, and encrypting the communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-certificates-management/tls.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-certificates-management/tls.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 1. TLS certificate issuance and validation process&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 1. TLS certificate issuance and validation process&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the detailed steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The server (website owner) submits a certificate signing request to the CA;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CA verifies the server’s identity and the authenticity of the website and issues a digital certificate to the server, which the server installs so that visitors can verify the website’s security;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user sends a request to the website through a browser (client);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The server returns the TLS certificate to the client;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client verifies the certificate’s validity with the CA and establishes the connection if the certificate is valid, or prompts the user to reject the connection if it is invalid;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client generates a pair of random public and private keys;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client sends its public key to the server;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The server encrypts the message using the client’s public key;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The server sends the encrypted data to the client;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client decrypts the data sent by the server using its private key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, both parties have established a secure channel and can transmit encrypted data in both directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-generate-certificates&#34;&gt;How to Generate Certificates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can generate X.509 certificates with the following open-source tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa&#34; title=&#34;Easy-RSA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Easy-RSA&lt;/a&gt;
: A simple command-line tool maintained by the OpenVPN project, EasyRSA can easily generate secure certificates and keys for the OpenVPN network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openssl/openssl&#34; title=&#34;OpenSSL&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;OpenSSL&lt;/a&gt;
: Originated by an individual in 1995 and now maintained by an independent organization, OpenSSL provides only a command-line tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl&#34; title=&#34;CFSSL&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CFSSL&lt;/a&gt;
: Developed and maintained by CloudFlare, CFSSL is not just a command-line tool for generating certificates but also can serve as a PKI server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/google/boringssl&#34; title=&#34;BoringSSL&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;BoringSSL&lt;/a&gt;
: A branch of OpenSSL developed and maintained by Google, BoringSSL is used in the Chrome browser and Android operating system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since most people are probably familiar with OpenSSL, we will use OpenSSL to create certificates in the following text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;certificate-trust-chain&#34;&gt;Certificate Trust Chain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The validation of a certificate requires using a certificate trust chain (Certificate Trust Chain). A certificate trust chain refers to a series of certificates used for identity verification, which form a chain starting from a trusted root certificate issuing agency, connecting downward step by step, until a specific intermediate or terminal certificate is used for verifying a particular certificate. The trustworthiness of a digital certificate increases as the certificate level increases in the certificate trust chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Figure 2, you can see four trust chains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-certificates-management/certificate-trust-chain.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-certificates-management/certificate-trust-chain.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 2. Certificate trust chains&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 2. Certificate trust chains&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certificate trust chains are tree-like structures, where each CA can have one or more child CAs. There are three roles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Root CA:&lt;/strong&gt; The top-level CA can issue certificates to intermediate CAs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intermediate CA:&lt;/strong&gt; They can issue end-entity certificates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End entity:&lt;/strong&gt; A device or service that holds an end-entity certificate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Root CAs are the top-level issuing authorities for digital certificates, so the certificates they issue are the most trustworthy. Root certificate authorities are usually operated and regulated by government agencies or other authoritative organizations such as the International Infrastructure Security Organization. Common root CAs include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symantec/VeriSign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comodo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DigiCert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GlobalSign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GoDaddy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entrust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GeoTrust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RapidSSL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baltimore CyberTrust Root&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that the above list is just a sample. There are many other root CAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you open an HTTPS webpage in a Chrome browser, you can view the certificate information by clicking on the lock icon on the left side of the address bar, which includes the certificate trust chain, such as the certificate trust chain of &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetrate.io/&#34; title=&#34;https://tetrate.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://tetrate.io&lt;/a&gt;
 shown in Figure 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The certificate trust chain allows the client (such as a web browser) to verify each certificate step by step when verifying the terminal certificate to determine whether it is trustworthy. The principle of digital certificate issuance is that the CA binds the certificate owner’s public key and identity information together. Then the CA uses its proprietary private key to generate a formal digital signature to indicate that the CA issued this certificate. The digital signature on the certificate can be verified using the CA’s public key during certificate verification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-incorporate-istio-into-the-pki-certificate-trust-chain&#34;&gt;How to Incorporate Istio into the PKI Certificate Trust Chain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before using Istio, enterprises usually have their own internal public key infrastructure . How can Istio be incorporated into the PKI certificate trust chain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istio has built-in certificate management functions that can be used out of the box. When Istio is started, it will create a self-signed certificate for &lt;em&gt;istiod&lt;/em&gt; as the root certificate for all workloads in the mesh. The problem with this is that the built-in root certificate cannot achieve mutual trust between meshes if you have multiple meshes. The correct approach is not to use Istio’s self-signed certificate, but to incorporate Istio into your certificate trust chain and integrate Istio into your PKI, creating an intermediate certificate for each PKI mesh. In this way, two meshes have a shared trust root and can achieve mutual trust between meshes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrate the Istio mesh into your internal PKI certificate trust chain by creating an intermediate CA, as shown in Figure 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-certificates-management/cluster-ca.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-certificates-management/cluster-ca.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 4: Create intermediate CAs for the multi-cluster mesh to enable Istio to be included in the on-premises PKI certificate trust chain&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 4: Create intermediate CAs for the multi-cluster mesh to enable Istio to be included in the on-premises PKI certificate trust chain&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many benefits to incorporating Istio into your company’s internal PKI certificate trust chain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure communication across grids/clusters&lt;/strong&gt;: with a common trust root, clusters can verify each other’s identities and communicate with each other;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More granular certificate revocation:&lt;/strong&gt; you can revoke the certificate of an individual entity or intermediate CA to revoke the certificate for service or cluster;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy implementation of certificate rotation:&lt;/strong&gt; you can rotate certificates by cluster/mesh rather than rotating the root node certificate, which reduces downtime. It is recommended to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager&#34; title=&#34;cert-manager&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;cert-manager&lt;/a&gt;
 to achieve automated large-scale CA certificate rotation in production. For more information, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetrate.io/blog/automate-istio-ca-rotation-in-production-at-scale/&#34; title=&#34;Automate Istio CA Rotation in Production at Scale&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Automate Istio CA Rotation in Production at Scale&lt;/a&gt;
;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For detailed instructions on incorporating Istio into your company’s internal PKI certificate trust chain, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetrate.io/blog/istio-trust/&#34; title=&#34;this blog post&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;steps-for-using-a-custom-ca-in-istio&#34;&gt;Steps for Using a Custom CA in Istio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, the Istio CA generates a self-signed root certificate and key and uses them to sign workload certificates. To protect the root CA key, you should use a root CA that runs offline on a secure machine and the root CA to issue intermediate certificates to the Istio CA running on each cluster. The Istio CA can then use the administrator-specified certificate and key to sign workload certificates and distribute the administrator-specified root certificate as the trusted root to workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 5 shows the certificate issuance and mounting process in Istio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-certificates-management/cert-process.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-certificates-management/cert-process.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 5. Certificate issuance and mounting process in Istio&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 5. Certificate issuance and mounting process in Istio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Istio, the Envoy proxy injects two processes into the Pod: &lt;em&gt;envoy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;pilot-agent&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;pilot-agent&lt;/em&gt; generates a private key and uses the Secret Discovery Service (SDS) via a Unix Domain Socket (UDS) to request a certificate signing request (CSR) from the Certificate Authority (CA) through the &lt;em&gt;istiod&lt;/em&gt;, if you have not configured the CA plugin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;istiod&lt;/em&gt;, which has a built-in CA, returns the certificate to the &lt;em&gt;pilot-agent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;pilot-agent&lt;/em&gt; then sends the generated private key and the CA-returned certificate to the Envoy instance to mount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istio defaults to using the CA built into &lt;em&gt;istiod&lt;/em&gt;, but also supports injecting other CAs, see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/security/cert-management/plugin-ca-cert/&#34; title=&#34;Istio documentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio documentation&lt;/a&gt;
. Suppose you want to create identities for your services using custom CA certificates and keys. In that case, you will need to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a CA configuration file and use it to create self-signed CA root certificates and keys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a private key and signing request configuration files for the service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a certificate signing request (CSR) for the service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the root certificate and key, along with the service’s signing request file, to create a certificate for the service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we will detail the process of creating and mounting a certificate for the Bookinfo &lt;em&gt;productpage&lt;/em&gt; service using Istio’s built-in CA as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;process-for-istios-built-in-ca-to-issue-a-certificate&#34;&gt;Process for Istio’s Built-in CA to Issue a Certificate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Istio starts, it creates a self-signed CA certificate, which it then uses to issue certificates to services within the mesh. Below, we will manually simulate the steps for Istio’s built-in CA to issue a certificate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Create a CA private key &lt;strong&gt;ca.key&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Use the CA private key &lt;strong&gt;ca.key&lt;/strong&gt; to generate a self-signed certificate &lt;strong&gt;ca.pem&lt;/strong&gt;, which contains the CA’s information in the subject:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca.key -days &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;365&lt;/span&gt; -out ca.pem -config ca.conf
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Create the workload’s private key &lt;strong&gt;workload.key&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;openssl genrsa -out workload.key
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Create a certificate signing request configuration file &lt;strong&gt;csr.conf&lt;/strong&gt;, which contains the address of the CA and additional information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-ini&#34; data-lang=&#34;ini&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;[ req ]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;encrypt_key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;no&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;distinguished_name&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;dn&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;req_extensions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;req_ext&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;x509_extensions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;req_ext&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;[ req_dn ]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;Istio&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;CN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;productpage&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;[ req_ext ]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;basicConstraints&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;critical, CA:true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;keyUsage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;critical, digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, keyCertSign&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 6:&lt;/strong&gt; Create a certificate signing request &lt;strong&gt;workload.csr&lt;/strong&gt; based on the workload’s CSR configuration file &lt;strong&gt;csr.conf&lt;/strong&gt; and the workload’s private key file &lt;strong&gt;workload.key&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;openssl req -new -key workload.key -out workload.csr -config csr.conf
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 7:&lt;/strong&gt; Create certificate &lt;strong&gt;workload.pem&lt;/strong&gt; based on CA’s private key &lt;strong&gt;ca.key&lt;/strong&gt;, CA’s certificate &lt;strong&gt;ca.pem&lt;/strong&gt; and workload’s certificate signing request:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;openssl x509 -req -in workload.csr -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca.key &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    -CAcreateserial -out workload.pem -days &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;365&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    -extensions req_ext -extfile csr.conf -sha256
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 8:&lt;/strong&gt; View the certificate chain mounted by the Envoy proxy in the workload:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;istioctl proxy-config secret deployment/productpage-v1 -o json &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; jq -r &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;.dynamicActiveSecrets[0].secret.tlsCertificate.certificateChain.inlineBytes&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; base64 --decode &amp;gt; chain.pem
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;chain.pem&lt;/strong&gt; file holds the certificate chain for the &lt;em&gt;productpage&lt;/em&gt; service. Because we use the Istio built-in CA as the root CA, only one certificate is stored in this file, which can be viewed by running the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;openssl x509 -noout -text -in chain.pem
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 9:&lt;/strong&gt; View the root certificate mounted by the Envoy proxy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;istioctl proxy-config secret deployment/productpage-v1 -o json &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; jq -r &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;.dynamicActiveSecrets[1].secret.validationContext.trustedCa.inlineBytes&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; base64 --decode &amp;gt; root.pem
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;root.pem&lt;/strong&gt; is the root certificate, run the following command to view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;openssl x509 -noout -text -in root.pem
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the certificate is mounted to the Envoy proxy, &lt;em&gt;istiod&lt;/em&gt; will take care of periodically replacing the key certificate and revoking the key certificate as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article introduces you to the function of digital certificates and the trust chain, and how the built-in, out-of-the-box certificate manager operates in Istio. However, the built-in CA in Istio still has certain limitations. In the next blog, I will introduce how to use the SPIRE and cert-manager plugins to achieve fine-grained certificate management and automatic certificate rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to service mesh and Kubernetes security, we have a bunch of free online courses &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetr8.io/academy&#34; title=&#34;available at Tetrate Academy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;available at Tetrate Academy&lt;/a&gt;
 that will quickly get you up to speed with Istio and Envoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a fast way to get to production with Istio, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetr8.io/tid&#34; title=&#34;Tetrate Istio Distribution (TID)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tetrate Istio Distribution (TID)&lt;/a&gt;
. TID is Tetrate’s hardened, fully upstream Istio distribution, with FIPS-verified builds and support available. It’s a great way to get started with Istio knowing you have a trusted distribution to begin with, have an expert team supporting you, and also have the option to get to FIPS compliance quickly if you need to.Once you have Istio up and running, you will probably need simpler ways to manage and secure your services beyond what’s available in Istio, that’s where Tetrate Service Bridge comes in. You can learn more about how Tetrate Service Bridge makes service mesh more secure, manageable, and resilient &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetr8.io/tsb&#34; title=&#34;here&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/ambient-mesh-l4-traffic-path/&#34; title=&#34;In my last blog&#34;&gt;In my last blog&lt;/a&gt;
, I introduced transparent traffic intercepting and L4 routing in Ambient mode. In this blog, I will show you how L7 traffic is routed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure below shows the L7 network traffic path in ambient mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 1: L7 network traffic in ambient mesh&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The Waypoint proxy can be located on the same node as the application, and even all of the service and the Waypoint proxy can be on the same node. I draw them on three nodes for display purposes, but it has no significant impact on the actual traffic path, except that it is no longer sent to another node via eth0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following section, we will explore the process in Figure 1 from a hands-on perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;environments-for-waypoint-proxy&#34;&gt;Environments for Waypoint Proxy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s continue to view the environment description using the ambient mode Istio deployed in the previous blog. To illustrate the L7 network routing, we need to create a Gateway on top of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;kubectl apply -f - &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;kind: Gateway
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;metadata:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt; name: productpage
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt; annotations:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;   istio.io/service-account: bookinfo-productpage
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;spec:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt; gatewayClassName: istio-mesh
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After executing this command, a Waypoint proxy is created under the default namespace; in my environment, this pod is named &lt;code&gt;bookinfo-productpage-waypoint-proxy-6f88c55d59-4dzdx&lt;/code&gt; and is specifically used to handle L7 traffic to the &lt;em&gt;productpage&lt;/em&gt; service ( Service B), which I will call Waypoint proxy B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Waypoint proxy may be deployed in a different namespace, on a different node from the workload, or both. No matter where the Waypoint proxy is situated, the L7 traffic path is unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will omit the sections of this blog dealing with intercepting inbound and outbound traffic because the way transparent traffic is handled in ambient mesh in L4 and L7 networks is similar. Details are available in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/ambient-mesh-l4-traffic-path/&#34; title=&#34;prior blog&#34;&gt;prior blog&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will start directly with the traffic intercepted at Ztunnel A and then forward it to Envoy port 15006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;outbound-traffic-routing-on-ztunnel-a&#34;&gt;Outbound Traffic Routing on Ztunnel A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the following command to dump the Envoy proxy configuration on Ztunnel A:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;kubectl &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt; -n istio-system ztunnel-hptxk -c istio-proxy -- curl &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;127.0.0.1:15000/config_dump?include_eds&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;ztunnel-a-all-include-eds.json
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;10.8.14.226 is the Cluster IP of the target service, and the service port is 9080. The traffic will be routed to the &lt;code&gt;spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/sleep_to_server_waypoint_proxy_spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/bookinfo-productpage&lt;/code&gt; cluster. Let’s look at the configuration of that cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;     &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;   &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;last_updated&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;2022-11-17T03:27:46.140Z&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cluster, which is of type &lt;code&gt;ORIGINAL_DST&lt;/code&gt;, creates a direct HBONE tunnel with the upstream in order to send packets to port 15008 on Pod B. The traffic intercepting and routing of the Ztunnel in Node B is the same as in L4, so I won’t go over it here.dsr5t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L7 traffic routing is based on L4 with the addition of the Waypoint proxy, which is more complex to handle in Envoy. We can also create HPAs to scale it dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to service mesh and Kubernetes security, we have a bunch of free online courses &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetr8.io/academy&#34; title=&#34;available at Tetrate Academy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;available at Tetrate Academy&lt;/a&gt;
 that will quickly get you up to speed with Istio and Envoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a fast way to get to production with Istio, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetr8.io/tid&#34; title=&#34;Tetrate Istio Distribution (TID)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tetrate Istio Distribution (TID)&lt;/a&gt;
 . TID is Tetrate’s hardened, fully upstream Istio distribution, with FIPS-verified builds and support available. It’s a great way to get started with Istio knowing you have a trusted distribution to begin with, have an expert team supporting you, and also have the option to get to FIPS compliance quickly if you need to.Once you have Istio up and running, you will probably need simpler ways to manage and secure your services beyond what’s available in Istio, that’s where Tetrate Service Bridge comes in. You can learn more about how Tetrate Service Bridge makes service mesh more secure, manageable, and resilient &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetr8.io/tsb&#34; title=&#34;here&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>How Istio&#39;s Ambient Mode Transparent Proxy - tproxy Works Under the Hood</title>
      <link>https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/what-is-tproxy/</link>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Istio’s new “ambient mode” is &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetrate.io/blog/ambient-mesh-what-you-need-to-know-about-this-experimental-new-deployment-model-for-istio/&#34; title=&#34;an experimental, “sidecar-less” deployment model for Istio&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;an experimental, “sidecar-less” deployment model for Istio&lt;/a&gt;
. Instead of a sidecar proxy in front of every workload, ambient mode uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/tproxy.txt&#34; title=&#34;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;tproxy&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;tproxy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 and &lt;a href=&#34;https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/costinm/hbone&#34; title=&#34;HTTP Based Overlay Network Environment (HBONE)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;HTTP Based Overlay Network Environment (HBONE)&lt;/a&gt;
 as key technologies for transparent traffic intercepting and routing that we covered in our recent article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetrate.io/blog/transparent-traffic-intercepting-and-routing-in-the-l4-network-of-istio-ambient-mesh/&#34; title=&#34;transparent traffic intercepting and routing in the L4 network of Istio Ambient Mesh&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;transparent traffic intercepting and routing in the L4 network of Istio Ambient Mesh&lt;/a&gt;
. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at &lt;em&gt;tproxy&lt;/em&gt; and how it’s used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-proxy-for&#34;&gt;What Is a Proxy For?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proxies have a wide range of uses on the Internet, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request caching:&lt;/strong&gt; to speed up network response, acting similarly to a CDN.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traffic filtering&lt;/strong&gt;: used for network supervision, blocking or allowing access to specific hosts and websites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traffic forwarding:&lt;/strong&gt; used for load balancing or as a network relay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traffic management:&lt;/strong&gt; fine-grained management of traffic to and from the proxy, such as publishing to different backends by percentage, timeout and retry settings, circuit breaking, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security auditing:&lt;/strong&gt; logging and limiting client requests for billing or auditing purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;proxy-types&#34;&gt;Proxy Types&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways to classify proxies based on how they’re used. You can see two categories based on the location of the proxy in Figure 1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/what-is-tproxy/proxy.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/what-is-tproxy/proxy.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 1: Forward proxy and reverse proxy.&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 1: Forward proxy and reverse proxy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forward proxies&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://shadowsocks.org/&#34; title=&#34;like shadowsocks&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;like shadowsocks&lt;/a&gt;
) run on the client side and send requests to the server on behalf of the client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reverse proxies&lt;/strong&gt; (often in the form of a web server) accept Internet or external requests on behalf of the server and route them to the corresponding backends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proxies may be located on the same node as the client or server or on a different node. We can classify them as &lt;strong&gt;transparent&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;non-transparent&lt;/strong&gt; based on whether the client or server can see them. Figure 2 (below) shows the process of a client (A) sending a request to a server (C) through a proxy (B).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/what-is-tproxy/transparent-proxy.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/what-is-tproxy/transparent-proxy.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 2: Transparent vs. non-transparent proxies&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 2: Transparent vs. non-transparent proxies&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To use a &lt;strong&gt;non-transparent proxy,&lt;/strong&gt; the client needs to explicitly change the destination address to that of the proxy server and use the proxy protocol to connect to the proxy server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To use a &lt;strong&gt;transparent proxy,&lt;/strong&gt; the client and the server do not know the proxy is there, which means the client does not need to modify the destination address, and does not need to use the proxy protocol to connect to the proxy server; all the destination address conversion is done in the transparent proxy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-the-tproxy-transparent-proxy&#34;&gt;Using the &lt;em&gt;tproxy&lt;/em&gt; Transparent Proxy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;tproxy&lt;/em&gt; is a Linux kernel module (since Linux 2.2) that implements transparent proxies. To use &lt;em&gt;tproxy&lt;/em&gt;, you must first use &lt;em&gt;iptables&lt;/em&gt; to intercept the required packets at the required NIC, then listen for and forward the packet on that NIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow these steps to use &lt;em&gt;tproxy&lt;/em&gt; to implement a transparent proxy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, you need to implement traffic interception: create a rule in the mangle table of the PREROUTING chain of iptables to intercept traffic and send it to tproxy for processing, for example, &lt;code&gt;iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp -dport 9080 -j TPROXY --on-port 15001 --on-ip 127.0.0.1 --tproxy-mark 0x1/0x1&lt;/code&gt;, marking all TCP packets destined for port 9080 with a mark 1. You can specify the source IP address or &lt;a href=&#34;https://ipset.netfilter.org/&#34; title=&#34;IP set&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;IP set&lt;/a&gt;
 to further narrow the marking, with &lt;em&gt;tproxy&lt;/em&gt; listening on port 15001.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a routing rule that looks up all packets with mark 1 in a specific routing table: for example, &lt;code&gt;add ip rule add fwmark 1 lookup 100&lt;/code&gt;, so that all packets with &lt;code&gt;fwmark 1&lt;/code&gt; look up to the routing table 100.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mapping packets to specific local addresses: for example, &lt;code&gt;ip rule add local 0.0.0.0/0 dev lo table 100&lt;/code&gt;, which declares all IPv4 addresses as local in the routing table 100, but of course, this is just an example. In practice, you will need to forward packets with specific IPs to the local &lt;em&gt;lo&lt;/em&gt; loopback NIC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traffic has been intercepted on &lt;em&gt;tproxy’s&lt;/em&gt; listening port 15001 (enter from Linux kernel space into user space). You can write a web application to process the packets or use &lt;em&gt;tproxy&lt;/em&gt;-enabled software such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.squid-cache.org/&#34; title=&#34;Squid&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Squid&lt;/a&gt;
 or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.envoyproxy.io/&#34; title=&#34;Envoy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Envoy&lt;/a&gt;
 to process the packets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pros-and-cons-of-transparent-proxies&#34;&gt;Pros and Cons of Transparent Proxies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transparent proxies have the following advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher bandwidth and reduced transmission latency, thereby improving the quality of service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No need for users to configure networks and hosts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control access to network services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transparent proxies have the following disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorrectly configured, the transparent proxy may prevent connection to the Internet, leaving users unable to troubleshoot and fix errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security cannot be guaranteed, as intercepted user traffic may be tampered with by transparent proxies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The risk that transparent proxies may cache user information, leading to privacy leaks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a vital type of proxy, transparent proxies are used in a wide range of applications, whether in proxy software such as &lt;em&gt;shadowsocks&lt;/em&gt;, Xray, or in the Istio service mesh. Understanding how they work helps us use proxies correctly, and whether or not you use a transparent proxy depends on how much you trust and know about it.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In cloud native applications, a request often needs to be processed through a series of APIs or backend services, some of which are parallel and some serial and located on different platforms or nodes. How do we determine the service paths and nodes a call goes through to help us troubleshoot the problem? This is where distributed tracing comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article covers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How distributed tracing works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to choose distributed tracing software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use distributed tracing in Istio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to view distributed tracing data using Bookinfo and SkyWalking as examples&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;distributed-tracing-basics&#34;&gt;Distributed Tracing Basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distributed tracing is a method for tracing requests in a distributed system to help users better understand, control, and optimize distributed systems. There are two concepts used in distributed tracing: TraceID and SpanID. You can see them in Figure 1 below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TraceID&lt;/strong&gt; is a globally unique ID that identifies the trace information of a request. All traces of a request belong to the same TraceID, and the TraceID remains constant throughout the trace of the request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SpanID&lt;/strong&gt; is a locally unique ID that identifies a request’s trace information at a certain time. A request generates different SpanIDs at different periods, and SpanIDs are used to distinguish trace information for a request at different periods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TraceID and SpanID are the basis of distributed tracing. They provide a uniform identifier for request tracing in distributed systems and facilitate users’ ability to query, manage, and analyze the trace information of requests.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 1: Trace and span&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is the process of distributed tracing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a system receives a request, the distributed tracing system assigns a TraceID to the request, which is used to chain together the entire chain of invocations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The distributed trace system generates a SpanID and ParentID for each service call within the system for the request, which is used to record the parent-child relationship of the call; a Span without a ParentID is used as the entry point of the call chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TraceID and SpanID are to be passed during each service call.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When viewing a distributed trace, query the full process of a particular request by TraceID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-istio-implements-distributed-tracing&#34;&gt;How Istio Implements Distributed Tracing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istio’s distributed tracing is based on information collected by the Envoy proxy in the data plane. After a service request is intercepted by Envoy, Envoy adds tracing information as headers to the request forwarded to the destination workload. The following headers are relevant for distributed tracing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As TraceID: x-request-id&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used to establish parent-child relationships for Span in the LightStep trace: x-ot-span-context&amp;lt;/li&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used for Zipkin, also for Jaeger, SkyWalking, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation&#34; title=&#34;b3-propagation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;b3-propagation&lt;/a&gt;
:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;x-b3-traceid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;x-b3-traceid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;x-b3-spanid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;x-b3-parentspanid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;x-b3-sampled&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;x-b3-flags&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;b3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Datadog:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;x-datadog-trace-id&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;x-datadog-parent-id&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;x-datadog-sampling-priority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For SkyWalking: &lt;em&gt;sw8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For AWS X-Ray: &lt;em&gt;x-amzn-trace-id&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on how to use these headers, please see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_conn_man/headers&#34; title=&#34;Envoy documentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Envoy documentation&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the language of your application, Envoy will generate the appropriate tracing headers for you at the Ingress Gateway and forward these headers to the upstream cluster. However, in order to utilize the distributed tracing feature, you must modify your application code to attach the tracing headers to upstream requests. Since neither the service mesh nor the application can automatically propagate these headers, you can integrate the agent for distributed tracing into the application or manually propagate these headers in the application code itself. Once the tracing headers are propagated to all upstream requests, Envoy will send the tracing data to the tracer’s back-end processing, and then you can view the tracing data in the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, look at the code of the Productpage service in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/examples/bookinfo/&#34; title=&#34;Bookinfo application&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bookinfo application&lt;/a&gt;
. You can see that it integrates the Jaeger client library and synchronizes the header generated by Envoy with the HTTP requests to the Details and Reviews services in the &lt;em&gt;getForwardHeaders (request)&lt;/em&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Apache SkyWalking’s agent does not support as many languages as Jaeger and Zipkin, SkyWalking’s implementation is richer and compatible with Jaeger and Zipkin trace data, and development is more active, so it is one of the best choices for building a telemetry platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;demo&#34;&gt;Demo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refer to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/observability/distributed-tracing/skywalking/&#34; title=&#34;Istio documentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio documentation&lt;/a&gt;
 to install and configure Apache SkyWalking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;environment-description&#34;&gt;Environment Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is the environment for our demo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes 1.24.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Istio 1.16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SkyWalking 9.1.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;install-istio&#34;&gt;Install Istio&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before installing Istio, you can check the environment for any problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;$ istioctl experimental precheck
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;✔ No issues found when checking the cluster. Istio is safe to install or upgrade!
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  To get started, check out https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then install Istio and configure the destination for sending tracing messages as SkyWalking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Initial Istio Operator&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;istioctl operator init
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Configure tracing destination&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;kubectl apply -f - &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;deploy-apache-skywalking&#34;&gt;Deploy Apache SkyWalking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istio 1.16 supports distributed tracing using Apache SkyWalking. Install SkyWalking by executing the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;kubectl apply -f 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.16/samples/addons/extras/skywalking.yaml
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will install the following components under the &lt;em&gt;istio-system&lt;/em&gt; namespace:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about SkyWalking, please refer to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://skywalking.apache.org/docs/main/v9.3.0/readme/&#34; title=&#34;SkyWalking documentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SkyWalking documentation&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deploy-the-bookinfo-application&#34;&gt;Deploy the Bookinfo Application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Execute the following command to install the bookinfo application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;kubectl label namespace default istio-injection&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;enabled
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launch the SkyWalking UI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;istioctl dashboard skywalking
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 shows all the services available in the bookinfo application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/distributed-tracing-with-skywalking-in-istio/general-service.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/distributed-tracing-with-skywalking-in-istio/general-service.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;1622&#34; data-height=&#34;1080&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 2: SkyWalking General Service page&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 2: SkyWalking General Service page&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also see information about instances, endpoints, topology, tracing, etc. For example, Figure 3 shows the service topology of the bookinfo application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 3: Topology diagram of the Bookinfo application&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracing views in SkyWalking can be displayed in a variety of formats, including list, tree, table, and statistics. See Figure 4:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/distributed-tracing-with-skywalking-in-istio/gs-styles.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/distributed-tracing-with-skywalking-in-istio/gs-styles.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;2062&#34; data-height=&#34;1080&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 4: SkyWalking General Service trace supports multiple display formats&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 4: SkyWalking General Service trace supports multiple display formats&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To facilitate our examination, set the sampling rate of the trace to 100%:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;kubectl apply -f - &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;apiVersion: telemetry.istio.io/v1alpha1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;kind: Telemetry
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;metadata:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;  name: mesh-default
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;  namespace: istio-system
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;spec:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;  tracing:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;  - randomSamplingPercentage: 100.00
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;It’s generally not good practice to set the sampling rate to 100% in a production environment. To avoid the overhead of generating too many trace logs in production, please adjust the sampling strategy (sampling percentage).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;uninstall&#34;&gt;Uninstall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After experimenting, uninstall Istio and SkyWalking by executing the following command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/cleanup.sh
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;istioctl unintall --purge
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;kubectl delete namespace istio-system
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-the-bookinfo-tracing-information&#34;&gt;Understanding the Bookinfo Tracing Information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigate to the General Service tab in the Apache SkyWalking UI, and you can see the trace information for the most recent &lt;em&gt;istio-ingressgateway&lt;/em&gt; service, as shown in Figure 5. Click on each span to see the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/distributed-tracing-with-skywalking-in-istio/span-table.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/distributed-tracing-with-skywalking-in-istio/span-table.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;1495&#34; data-height=&#34;1080&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 5: The table view shows the basic information about each span.&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 5: The table view shows the basic information about each span.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching to the list view, you can see the execution order and duration of each span, as shown in Figure 6:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/distributed-tracing-with-skywalking-in-istio/trace-list.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/distributed-tracing-with-skywalking-in-istio/trace-list.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;1190&#34; data-height=&#34;816&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 6: List display&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 6: List display&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might want to know why such a straightforward application generates so much span data. Because after we inject the Envoy proxy into the pod, every request between services will be intercepted and processed by Envoy, as shown in Figure 7:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 7: Envoy intercepts requests to generate a span&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tracing process is shown in Figure 8:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/distributed-tracing-with-skywalking-in-istio/bookinfo-spans-with-time.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/distributed-tracing-with-skywalking-in-istio/bookinfo-spans-with-time.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 8: Trace of the Bookinfo application&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 8: Trace of the Bookinfo application&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give each span a label with a serial number, and the time taken is indicated in parentheses. For illustration purposes, we have summarized all spans in the table below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;No.&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Endpoint&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Total Duration (ms)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Component Duration (ms)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Current Service&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the above information, it can be seen that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The total time consumed for this request is 190 ms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Istio sidecar mode, each traffic flow in and out of the application container must pass through the Envoy proxy once, each time taking 0 to 2 ms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network requests between Pods take between 1 and 16ms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is because the data itself has errors and the start time of the Span is not necessarily equal to the end time of the parent Span.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can see that the most time-consuming part is the Reviews application, which takes 109 ms so that we can optimize it for that application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distributed tracing is an indispensable tool for analyzing performance and troubleshooting modern distributed applications. In this tutorial, we’ve seen how, with just a few minor changes to your application code to propagate tracing headers, Istio makes distributed tracing simple to use. We’ve also reviewed &lt;a href=&#34;https://skywalking.apache.org/&#34; title=&#34;Apache SkyWalking&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Apache SkyWalking&lt;/a&gt;
 as one of the best distributed tracing systems that Istio supports. It is a fully functional platform for cloud native application analytics, with features such as metrics and log collection, alerting, Kubernetes monitoring, &lt;a href=&#34;https://skywalking.apache.org/blog/diagnose-service-mesh-network-performance-with-ebpf/&#34; title=&#34;service mesh performance diagnosis using eBPF&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;service mesh performance diagnosis using eBPF&lt;/a&gt;
, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to service mesh and Kubernetes security, we have a bunch of free online courses &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetr8.io/academy&#34; title=&#34;available at Tetrate Academy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;available at Tetrate Academy&lt;/a&gt;
 that will quickly get you up to speed with Istio and Envoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a fast way to get to production with Istio, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetr8.io/tid&#34; title=&#34;Tetrate Istio Distribution (TID)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tetrate Istio Distribution (TID)&lt;/a&gt;
. TID is Tetrate’s hardened, fully upstream Istio distribution, with FIPS-verified builds and support available. It’s a great way to get started with Istio knowing you have a trusted distribution to begin with, have an expert team supporting you, and also have the option to get to FIPS compliance quickly if you need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have Istio up and running, you will probably need simpler ways to manage and secure your services beyond what’s available in Istio, that’s where Tetrate Service Bridge comes in. You can learn more about how Tetrate Service Bridge makes service mesh more secure, manageable, and resilient &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetr8.io/tsb&#34; title=&#34;here&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The Istio service mesh offers cloud native deployments a standard way to implement automatic &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication#mTLS&#34; title=&#34;mutual transport layer security (mTLS)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;mutual transport layer security (mTLS)&lt;/a&gt;
. This reduces the attack surface of network communication by using strong identities to establish encrypted channels between workloads within the mesh that are both confidential and tamper-resistant. mTLS is a key component for building zero-trust application networks. To understand mTLS traffic encryption in Istio, this article will cover the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An overview of TLS, mTLS, and TLS termination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An introduction to howTLS encryption works in Istio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use Istio to implement mTLS in Kubernetes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A discussion of when you do and don’t need mTLS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-tls-and-mtls&#34;&gt;What Is TLS and mTLS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TLS, the successor to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), is a widely adopted security protocol used to create authenticated and encrypted connections between networked computers. For this reason, people often use the terms TLS and SSL interchangeably. In this article, we will refer to them collectively as TLS. TLS 1.0 was released in 1999, and the latest version is 1.3 (released in August 2018); versions 1.0 and 1.1 are deprecated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HTTPS we see when browsing the web uses TLS, as shown in Figure 1, which is built on top of TCP as the session layer in the OSI model. To ensure compatibility, TLS usually uses port 443, but you can use any port you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/understanding-the-tls-encryption-in-istio/http-vs-https.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/understanding-the-tls-encryption-in-istio/http-vs-https.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 1: HTTP vs. HTTPS&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 1: HTTP vs. HTTPS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TLS encryption is required when a client needs to confirm the identity of the server in order to guard against man-in-the-middle attacks and ensure communication security. Figure 2 shows how TLS-encrypted communication proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/understanding-the-tls-encryption-in-istio/tls-flow.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/understanding-the-tls-encryption-in-istio/tls-flow.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 2: simplified TLS handshake flow&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 2: simplified TLS handshake flow&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The server applies for and obtains a certificate (X.509 certificate) from a trusted &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority&#34; title=&#34;certificate authority&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;certificate authority&lt;/a&gt;
 (CA).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A request from the client to the server containing information such as the TLS version and password combination supported by the client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The server responds to the client request and attaches a digital certificate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client verifies the status, validity, and digital signature of the certificate and confirms the identity of the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encrypted communication commences between the client and the server using a shared private key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above is only an outline description of the TLS communication flow. If you’re interested in the details, please see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake/&#34; title=&#34;this in-depth discussion of the complete TLS handshake process.&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this in-depth discussion of the complete TLS handshake process.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the above process, you will find that the certificate is the critical element representing the server’s identity. The server must use a certificate issued by an authoritatively certified CA in order to provide public services over the Internet. In contrast, you can manage certificates using your own public key infrastructure (PKI) for services inside of a private environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutual TLS, also referred to as mTLS, is the use of a two-way encrypted channel between a server and a client that necessitates certificate exchange and identity authentication between the parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-tls-termination&#34;&gt;What Is TLS Termination?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TLS termination is the process of decrypting TLS-encrypted traffic before it is forwarded to a web server. Offloading TLS traffic to an ingress gateway or specialized device improves web application performance while securing encrypted traffic. TLS termination is typically implemented at cluster ingress. All communication between the ingress and servers in the cluster will be conducted directly over HTTP in plaintext, enhancing service performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/understanding-the-tls-encryption-in-istio/tls-termination.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/understanding-the-tls-encryption-in-istio/tls-termination.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 3: TLS termination&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 3: TLS termination&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, Istio enables mTLS for mesh-based services and ends TLS at the ingress gateway. Furthermore, you can pass through traffic to back-end services for processing.&lt;/p&gt;

—one of the discovery services in Envoy &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-docs/xds_protocol&#34; title=&#34;xDS&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;xDS&lt;/a&gt;
—enables the issuance and rotation of SVID certificates. The mTLS flow in the Istio mesh is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sidecar of every service requests a certificate from Istiod on behalf of the workload at startup, and Istiod issues the &lt;a href=&#34;https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/spiffe-about/spiffe-concepts/#spiffe-verifiable-identity-document-svid&#34; title=&#34;SVID&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SVID&lt;/a&gt;
 certificate (the process is more complex, and I will explain it in a future blog).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sidecar of every workload intercepts all client requests within the pod.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client sidecar starts an mTLS handshake with the server sidecar. During the handshake, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/security/jwt_authn_filter&#34; title=&#34;JWT&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;JWT&lt;/a&gt;
 and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/security/ext_authz_filter&#34; title=&#34;authentication filter&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;authentication filter&lt;/a&gt;
 in the client sidecar will authenticate the identity of the request, and store the identity in the filter metadata after the authentication. Then the request will go through the authorization filter to determine if the request is allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the request is authenticated and authorized, the client and the server start to establish a connection for communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Istio, authentication and authorization between services can be configured using one of three resource objects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/security/request_authentication/&#34; title=&#34;RequestAuthentication&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RequestAuthentication&lt;/a&gt;
:&lt;/strong&gt; To specify the service’s only currently supported request-level authentication method, JWT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/security/peer_authentication/&#34; title=&#34;PeerAuthentication&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;PeerAuthentication&lt;/a&gt;
:&lt;/strong&gt; To enable mTLS or plaintext requests, set the transport authentication mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/security/authorization-policy/&#34; title=&#34;AuthorizationPolicy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;AuthorizationPolicy&lt;/a&gt;
:&lt;/strong&gt; To specify who can do what when traffic between services is authorized? For instance, subject A either permits (ALLOW) or forbids (DENY) traffic from subject B.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-enable-automatic-mtls-in-istio&#34;&gt;How to Enable Automatic mTLS in Istio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In PeerAuthentication, you can specify the mTLS mode that will be used for the target workload. Peer authentication is supported in the following modes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PERMISSIVE: The workload’s default setting that allows it to accept either mTLS or plain text traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;STRICT: The workload accepts only mTLS traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DISABLE: Disable mTLS. From a security perspective, mTLS should not be disabled unless you have your own security solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UNSET: Inherited from the parent, with the following priority: service specific &amp;gt; namespace scope &amp;gt; mesh scope setting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istio’s peer authentication uses &lt;em&gt;PERMISSIVE&lt;/em&gt; mode by default, automatically sending &lt;em&gt;mTLS&lt;/em&gt; traffic to these workloads and clear text traffic to workloads without a sidecar. After including Kubernetes services in the Istio mesh, we can use &lt;em&gt;PERMISSIVE&lt;/em&gt; mode first to prevent services from failing &lt;em&gt;mTLS&lt;/em&gt;. We can use one of two ways to enable strict mTLS mode for certain services:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use PeerAuthentication to define how traffic is transferred between sidecars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use DestinationRule to define the TLS settings in the traffic routing policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reviews service’s mTLS configuration in the default namespace can be seen in the example below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;use-peerauthentication-to-set-mtls-for-workloads&#34;&gt;Use PeerAuthentication to Set mTLS for Workloads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the following configuration can be used to specify that a workload under a namespace has strict mTLS enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;security.istio.io/v1beta1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;reviews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;mtls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;STRICT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/security/authentication/mtls-migration/&#34; title=&#34;Istio documentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio documentation&lt;/a&gt;
, you can also enable strict mTLS for all services in the mesh by configuring strict mTLS for the namespace istio-system where Istio is installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;use-destinationrule-to-set-up-mtls-for-workloads&#34;&gt;Use DestinationRule to Set up mTLS for Workloads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traffic routing policies, such as load balancing, anomaly detection, TLS settings, etc., are set using DestinationRule. In the TLS settings, there are various modes. As shown below, use ISTIO_MUTUAL mode to enable Istio’s workload-based automatic TLS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;networking.istio.io/v1beta1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;DestinationRule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;trafficPolicy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;tls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;ISTIO_MUTUAL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-should-you-use-mtls&#34;&gt;When Should You Use mTLS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer is that you should use mTLS for network communication between application components that you have some control over—like between microservices in a cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-way TLS is typically used by Internet clients to connect to Web services, which means that only the server needs to show identification and is unconcerned with the identity of the client. One-way TLS allows you to use passwords, tokens, two-factor authentication, and other methods when you need to confirm the identity of the client. However, when using a service mesh, mTLS operates outside the application and doesn’t require many changes to the application logic, whereas such an authentication method requires internal application support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the example above, mTLS implementation calls for certificate exchange between services. As the number of services rises, managing numerous certificates becomes a laborious task. You can implement automatic mTLS and fix the certificate management issue with the aid of a service mesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-shouldnt-you-use-mtls&#34;&gt;When Shouldn’t You Use mTLS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although mTLS is the preferred protocol for securing inter-service communication in cloud-native applications, implementing mTLS necessitates a more complex, symmetric encryption and decryption process than one-way TLS. In some cases where there is high traffic volume or CPU utilization must be optimized, terminatingTLS at the traffic entry point and turning on mTLS internally for specific services only can help minimize request response times and decrease compute resource consumption for some traffic with lower security levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it is necessary to &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/configuration/mesh/app-health-check/#disable-the-http-probe-rewrite-for-a-pod&#34; title=&#34;disable probe rewriting for pods&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;disable probe rewriting for pods&lt;/a&gt;
 when using services that cannot obtain certificates, such as health checks performed via HTTP on Kubelet and the inability to access the service’s health check endpoint via TLS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, when mesh services access some external services, mTLS is also not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mTLS is a crucial component of creating a zero-trust application network, which makes it possible to encrypt traffic within the mesh. Istio makes it simple to enable automatic mTLS for Kubernetes services, doing away with the need to manage certificates. At the same time, we can selectively enable mTLS for a subset of the mesh’s services, enabling us to move services from Kubernetes to the mesh. In a subsequent blog, we’ll go into more detail about Istio’s certificate management system. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to service mesh and Kubernetes security, we have a bunch of free online courses &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetr8.io/academy&#34; title=&#34;available at Tetrate Academy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;available at Tetrate Academy&lt;/a&gt;
 that will quickly get you up to speed with Istio and Envoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a fast way to get to production with Istio, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetr8.io/tid&#34; title=&#34;Tetrate Istio Distribution (TID)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tetrate Istio Distribution (TID)&lt;/a&gt;
. TID is Tetrate’s hardened, fully upstream Istio distribution, with FIPS-verified builds and support available. It’s a great way to get started with Istio knowing you have a trusted distribution to begin with, have an expert team supporting you, and also have the option to get to FIPS compliance quickly if you need to.Once you have Istio up and running, you will probably need simpler ways to manage and secure your services beyond what’s available in Istio, that’s where Tetrate Service Bridge comes in. You can learn more about how Tetrate Service Bridge makes service mesh more secure, manageable, and resilient &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetr8.io/tsb&#34; title=&#34;here&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Ambient mesh is an experimental new deployment model recently introduced to Istio. It splits the duties currently performed by the Envoy sidecar into two separate components: a node-level component for encryption (called “ztunnel”) and an L7 Envoy instance deployed per service for all other processing (called “waypoint”). The ambient mesh model is an attempt to gain some efficiencies in potentially improved lifecycle and resource management. You can learn more about what ambient mesh is and how it differs from the Sidecar pattern &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetrate.io/blog/ambient-mesh-what-you-need-to-know-about-this-experimental-new-deployment-model-for-istio/&#34; title=&#34;here&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article takes you step-by-step through a hands-on approach to the transparent traffic intercepting and routing of L4 traffic paths in the Istio’s Ambient mode. If you don’t know what Ambient mode is, &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetrate.io/blog/ambient-mesh-what-you-need-to-know-about-this-experimental-new-deployment-model-for-istio/&#34; title=&#34;this article&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;
 can help you understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to skip the actual hands-on steps and just want to know the L4 traffic path in Ambient mode, please see the figure below, it shows a Pod of Service A calling a Pod of Service B on a different node below.&lt;/p&gt;

 and &lt;a href=&#34;https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/costinm/hbone&#34; title=&#34;HTTP Based Overlay Network Environment (HBONE)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;HTTP Based Overlay Network Environment (HBONE)&lt;/a&gt;
 as key technologies for transparent traffic intercepting and routing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using tproxy to intercept the traffic from the host Pod into the Ztunnel (Envoy Proxy).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using HBONE to establish a tunnel for passing TCP traffic between Ztunnels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-tproxy&#34;&gt;What Is tproxy?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tproxy is a transparent proxy supported by the Linux kernel since version 2.2, where the t stands for transparent. You need to enable &lt;em&gt;NETFILTER_TPROXY&lt;/em&gt; and policy routing in the kernel configuration. With tproxy, the Linux kernel can act as a router and redirect packets to user space. See the &lt;a href=&#34;http://lxr.linux.no/linux&amp;#43;v3.10/Documentation/networking/tproxy.txt&#34; title=&#34;tproxy documentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;tproxy documentation&lt;/a&gt;
 for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-hbone&#34;&gt;What Is HBONE?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HBONE is a method of providing tunneling capabilities using the HTTP protocol. A client sends an &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/CONNECT&#34; title=&#34;HTTP CONNECT&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;HTTP CONNECT&lt;/a&gt;
 request (which contains the destination address) to an HTTP proxy server to establish a tunnel, and the proxy server establishes a TCP connection to the destination on behalf of the client, which can then transparently transport TCP data streams to the destination server through the proxy. In Ambient mode, Ztunnel (Envoy inside) acts as a transparent proxy, using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/other_features/internal_listener&#34; title=&#34;Envoy Internal Listener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Envoy Internal Listener&lt;/a&gt;
 to receive HTTP CONNECT requests and pass TCP streams to the upstream cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because these names will be used in subsequent command lines, the text will use pronouns, so that you can experiment in your own environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the tutorial, I installed Istio Ambient mode in GKE. You can refer to this &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/blog/2022/get-started-ambient/&#34; title=&#34;Istio blog post&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio blog post&lt;/a&gt;
 for installation instructions. Be careful not to install the Gateway, so as not to enable the L7 functionality; otherwise, the traffic path will be different from the descriptions in this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following, we will experiment and dive into the L4 traffic path of a pod of &lt;em&gt;sleep&lt;/em&gt; service to a pod of &lt;em&gt;productpage&lt;/em&gt; service on different nodes. We will look at the outbound and inbound traffic of the Pods separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;outbound-traffic-intercepting&#34;&gt;Outbound Traffic Intercepting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transparent traffic intercepting process for outbound traffic from a pod in Ambient mesh is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Istio CNI creates the &lt;em&gt;istioout&lt;/em&gt; NIC and iptables rules on the node, adds the Pods’ IP in Ambient mesh to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ipset.netfilter.org/&#34; title=&#34;IP set&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;IP set&lt;/a&gt;
, and transparently intercepts outbound traffic from Ambient mesh to &lt;em&gt;pistioout&lt;/em&gt; virtual NIC through &lt;a href=&#34;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8926/&#34; title=&#34;Geneve (Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Geneve (Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation)&lt;/a&gt;
 tunnels with netfilter &lt;em&gt;nfmark&lt;/em&gt; tags and routing rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The init container in Ztunnel creates iptables rules that forward all traffic from the &lt;em&gt;pistioout&lt;/em&gt; NIC to port 15001 of the Envoy proxy in Ztunnel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Envoy processes the packets and establishes an HBONE tunnel (HTTP CONNECT) with the upstream endpoints to forward the packets upstream.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;check-the-routing-rules-on-node-a&#34;&gt;Check The Routing Rules On Node A&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log in to Node A, where Service A is located, and use &lt;code&gt;iptables-save&lt;/code&gt; to check the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPtables rule descriptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Line 3: the &lt;em&gt;PREROUTING&lt;/em&gt; chain is the first to run, and all packets will go to the &lt;em&gt;ztunnel-PEROUTING&lt;/em&gt; chain first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Line 4: packets are sent to the &lt;em&gt;KUBE-SERVICES&lt;/em&gt; chain, where the Cluster IP of the Kubernetes Service is DNAT’d to the Pod IP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Line 6: packets with 0x100/0x100 flags pass through the &lt;em&gt;PREROUTING&lt;/em&gt; chain and no longer go through the &lt;em&gt;KUBE-SERVICES&lt;/em&gt; chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Line 35: this is the last rule added to the &lt;em&gt;ztunnel-PREROUTING&lt;/em&gt; chain; all TCP packets entering the &lt;em&gt;ztunnel-PREROUTING&lt;/em&gt; chain that are in the &lt;em&gt;ztunnel-pods-ips&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://ipset.netfilter.org/&#34; title=&#34;IP set&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;IP set&lt;/a&gt;
 (created by the Istio CNI) are marked with 0x100/0x100, which overrides all previous marks. See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ipset.netfilter.org/iptables-extensions.man.html#lbDD&#34; title=&#34;Netfilter documentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Netfilter documentation&lt;/a&gt;
 for more information about &lt;em&gt;nfmark&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By implementing the above iptables rules, we can ensure that ambient mesh only intercepts packets from the &lt;em&gt;ztunnel-pods-ips&lt;/em&gt; IP set pods and marks the packets with 0x100/0x100 (&lt;em&gt;nfmark&lt;/em&gt;, in value/mask format, both value and mask are 32-bit binary integers) without affecting other pods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the routing rules for this node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;101:    from all fwmark 0x100/0x100 lookup &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;101&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;32767:  from all lookup default
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The routing table will be executed sequentially, with the first column indicating the priority of the routing table and the second column indicating the routing table to look for or jump to. You will see that all packets marked with 0x100/0x100 will look for the 101 routing table. Let’s look at that routing table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;$ ip route show table &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;101&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;default via 192.168.127.2 dev istioout 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;10.4.4.18 dev veth52b75946 scope link 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will see the 101 routing table with the keyword via, which indicates that the packets will be transmitted through the gateway, &lt;a href=&#34;http://linux-ip.net/html/tools-ip-route.html#tools-ip-route-show&#34; title=&#34;see the usage of the ip route command&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;see the usage of the ip route command&lt;/a&gt;
. All packets are sent through the &lt;em&gt;istioout&lt;/em&gt; NIC to the gateway (IP is 192.168.127.2). The other line indicates the routing link for the &lt;em&gt;ztunnel&lt;/em&gt; pod on the current node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the details of the &lt;em&gt;istioout&lt;/em&gt; NIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;istioout&lt;/em&gt; NIC in Pod A is connected to the &lt;em&gt;pstioout&lt;/em&gt; NIC in &lt;em&gt;ztunnel&lt;/em&gt; A through the Geneve tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;check-the-routing-rules-on-ztunnel-a&#34;&gt;Check The Routing Rules On Ztunnel A&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to the &lt;em&gt;Ztunnel&lt;/em&gt; A Pod and use the &lt;em&gt;ip -d&lt;/em&gt; a command to check its NIC information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find two NICs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;pistioin&lt;/em&gt; ：192.168.126.2, for the inbound traffic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;pistioout&lt;/em&gt;：192.168.127.2 for the outbound traffic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you handle traffic from Pod A after it enters ztunnel? The answer is iptables. Look at the iptables rules in ztunnel A:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;/* omit */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that all TCP traffic in Ztunnel A destined for the pistioin NIC is transparently forwarded to port 15001 (Envoy’s outbound port) and tagged with 0x400/0xfff. This marker ensures that packets are sent to the correct NIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the routing rules In Ztunnel A:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;$ ip rule
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;0:      from all lookup &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;20000:  from all fwmark 0x400/0xfff lookup &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;20001:  from all fwmark 0x401/0xfff lookup &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;101&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;20002:  from all fwmark 0x402/0xfff lookup &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;102&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;20003:  from all fwmark 0x4d3/0xfff lookup &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;32766:  from all lookup main
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;32767:  from all lookup default
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will see that all packets marked 0x400/0xfff go to the 101 routing table, and we look at the details of that routing table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;$ ip route show table &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;local&lt;/span&gt; default dev lo scope host 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will see that this is a local route and the packet is sent to the loopback NIC, which is 127.0.0.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the transparent intercepting process of outbound traffic in the pod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;outbound-traffic-routing-on-ztunnel-a&#34;&gt;Outbound Traffic Routing On Ztunnel A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outbound traffic is intercepted onto Ztunnel and processed into Envoy’s port 15001. Let’s see how Ztunnel routes outbound traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The Envoy filter rules in Ztunnel are completely different from the Envoy filter rules in Sidecar mode, so instead of using the &lt;em&gt;istioctl proxy-config&lt;/em&gt; command to inspect the configuration of Listener, Cluster, Endpoint, etc., we directly export the complete Envoy configuration in Ztunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get the Envoy configuration in Ztunnel A directly and remotely on your local machine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;kubectl &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt; -n istio-system ztunnel-hptxk -c istio-proxy -- curl &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;127.0.0.1:15000/config_dump?include_eds&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;ztunnel-a-all-include-eds.json
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Do not use &lt;em&gt;istioctl proxy-config all ztunnel-rts54 -n istio-system&lt;/em&gt; command to get the Envoy configuration, because the configuration so obtained does not contain the EDS part. The exported JSON file will have tens of thousands of lines, so it is recommended to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/antonmedv/fx&#34; title=&#34;fx &#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;fx &lt;/a&gt;
or other tools to parse the file for readability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ztunnel_outbound-listener&#34;&gt;Ztunnel_outbound Listener&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Envoy configuration contains the traffic rule configuration for all pods on this node. Let’s inspect the &lt;em&gt;ztunnel_outbound&lt;/em&gt; Listener section configuration (some parts are omitted due to too much configuration):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Line 6: This Cluster configuration uses EDS to get endpoints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Line 18: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/transport_sockets/internal_upstream/v3/internal_upstream.proto#envoy-v3-api-msg-extensions-transport-sockets-internal-upstream-v3-internalupstreamtransport&#34; title=&#34;InternalUpstreamTransport&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;InternalUpstreamTransport&lt;/a&gt;
 is applied to all byte streams with a tunnel: h2 metadata for internal addresses, defining loopback userspace sockets located in the same proxy instance. In addition to regular byte streams, this extension allows the additional structured state to be passed across userspace sockets (&lt;code&gt;passthrough_metadata&lt;/code&gt;). The purpose is to facilitate communication between downstream filters and upstream internal connections. All filter state objects shared with the upstream connection are also shared with the downstream inner connection via this transportation socket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lines 23 to 37: structured data passed upstream.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Line 4: As of the first release of Ambient mesh, this field was not actually present when the Envoy configuration was exported, but it is should have it. Otherwise, it would be impossible to determine which Cluster the Endpoint belongs to. The mandatory &lt;code&gt;cluster_name&lt;/code&gt; field is missing from the &lt;code&gt;endpoint_config&lt;/code&gt; here, probably due to a bug in Ambient mode that caused the field to be missing when exporting Envoy’s configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Line 13: the address of the Endpoint is an &lt;code&gt;envoy_internal_address&lt;/code&gt;，&lt;code&gt;Envoy internal listener&lt;/code&gt;outbound_tunnel_lis_spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/sleep`.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Line 14: packets will be forwarded to the &lt;code&gt;outbound_tunnel_clus_spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/sleep cluster&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lines 18 – 28: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/network/tcp_proxy/v3/tcp_proxy.proto#envoy-v3-api-msg-extensions-filters-network-tcp-proxy-v3-tcpproxy-tunnelingconfig&#34; title=&#34;tunneling_config&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;tunneling_config&lt;/a&gt;
 , used to configure the upstream HTTP CONNECT tunnel. In addition, the TcpProxy filter in this listener passes traffic to the upstream p cluster. HTTP CONNECT tunnels (which carry traffic sent to &lt;code&gt;10.4.3.20:9080&lt;/code&gt;) are set up on the TCP filter for use by the Ztunnel on the node where the productpage is located. As many tunnels are created, as there are endpoints. HTTP tunnels are the bearer protocol for secure communication between Ambient components. The packet in the tunnel also adds the &lt;code&gt;x-envoy-original-dst-host&lt;/code&gt; header, which sets the destination address based on the parameters in the metadata of the endpoint selected in the previous EDS step. The endpoint selected in the previous EDS is 10.4.3.20:9080, so the tunnel listener here sets the header value to 10.4.3.20:9080, so keep an eye on this header as it will be used at the other end of the tunnel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Line 40: The listener filter is executed first in the listener. The &lt;code&gt;set_dst_address&lt;/code&gt; filter sets the upstream address to the downstream destination address.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Lines 22 – 41: the upstream TLS certificate is configured.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lines 45 – 48: the upstream port is overridden with 15008.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above is the whole process of transparent outbound traffic intercepting using tproxy and HBONE tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;inbound-traffic-intercepting&#34;&gt;Inbound Traffic Intercepting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node B receives requests from Node A to &lt;code&gt;10.4.3.20:15008&lt;/code&gt;. Inbound traffic intercepting in Ambient mode is similar to outbound. It also uses tproxy and HBONE to achieve transparent traffic intercepting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transparent traffic intercepting process for inbound traffic to the pod of Ambient mesh is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Istio CNI creates the istioin NIC and iptables rules on the node, adds the pods IP in Ambient mesh to the IP set, and transparently hijacks outbound traffic from Ambient mesh to the pistioin VM through the Geneve tunnel by using Netfilter nfmark tags and routing rules. NICs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The init container in Ztunnel creates iptables rules that forward all traffic from the pistioin NIC to port 15008 of the Envoy proxy in Ztunnel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Envoy processes the packets and forwards them to Pod B.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the checking procedure is similar to the outbound traffic, some of the output will be omitted below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;check-the-routing-rules-on-node-b&#34;&gt;Check the Routing Rules on Node B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log in to Node B, where Service B is located, and check the iptables on the node:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will see the previous command mentioned in the previous section to mark all packets sent by the pods in the &lt;code&gt;ztunnel-pods-ips&lt;/code&gt; IP set with 0x100/0x100: mark all packets with 0x200/0x200, and then continue with iptables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look into the routing table on node B:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of routing tables and rules are the same in all the nodes which belong to the ambient mesh. The routing table rules will be executed sequentially, looking first for the local table, then all packets with 0x200/0x200 flags will first jump to the main table (where veth routes are defined), and then to the 100 table, where the following rules are in place:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the output, istioin is a Geneve type virtual NIC that creates a Geneve tunnel with a remote IP of 10.4.3.14, which is the Pod IP of Ztunnel B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;check-the-routing-rules-on-ztunnel-b-pod&#34;&gt;Check The Routing Rules On Ztunnel B Pod&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to the Ztunnel B Pod and use the ip -d a command to check its NIC information. You will see that there is a pistioout NIC with an IP of 192.168.127.2, which is the far end of the Geneve tunnel created with the istioin virtual NIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use iptables-save to view the iptables rules within the Pod, and you will see that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;-A PREROUTING -i pistioin -p tcp -m tcp --dport &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;15008&lt;/span&gt; -j TPROXY --on-port &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;15008&lt;/span&gt; --on-ip 127.0.0.1 --tproxy-mark 0x400/0xfff

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All traffic destined for 10.4.3.20:15008 will be routed to port 15008 using tproxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15006 and 15008&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Port 15006 is used to process non-encrypted (plain) TCP packets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Port 15008 is used to process encrypted (TLS) TCP packets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above is the transparent intercepting process of inbound traffic in the Pod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;inbound-traffic-routing-on-ztunnel-b&#34;&gt;Inbound Traffic Routing On Ztunnel B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbound TLS encrypted traffic is intercepted on Ztunnel and goes to Envoy’s port 15008 for processing. Let’s look at how Ztunnel routes inbound traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s remotely get the Envoy configuration in Ztunnel B directly on our local machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;original_dst_lb_config&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line hl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;   &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;use_http_header&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;last_updated&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;2022-11-11T07:10:42.111Z&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Descriptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Line 7: the type of this cluster is ORIGINAL_DST, indicating that the original downstream destination is used as the route destination, i.e. 10.4.3.20:15008, which obviously has an incorrect port in this address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Line 9: a use_http_header of true will use the HTTP header x-envoy-original-dst-host as the destination, which has been set to 10.4.3.20:9080 in the outbound Ztunnel, and it will override the previously set destination address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the inbound traffic is accurately routed to the destination by Ztunnel. The above is the flow of L4 traffic hijacking and routing between nodes in Ambient mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For demonstration purposes, this article shows the paths of L4 network access packets for services on different nodes, even if the paths are similar for two services on the same node. Istio’s Ambient mode is still in its infancy, and during my testing, I also found that the EDS in the exported Envoy configuration was missing the cluster_name field. After understanding the L4 traffic path, I will share the L7 traffic path in Ambient mode in the future. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to service mesh and Kubernetes security, we have a bunch of free online courses &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetr8.io/academy&#34; title=&#34;available at Tetrate Academy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;available at Tetrate Academy&lt;/a&gt;
 that will quickly get you up to speed with Istio and Envoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a fast way to get to production with Istio, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetr8.io/tid&#34; title=&#34;Tetrate Istio Distribution (TID)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tetrate Istio Distribution (TID)&lt;/a&gt;
 . TID is Tetrate’s hardened, fully upstream Istio distribution, with FIPS-verified builds and support available. It’s a great way to get started with Istio knowing you have a trusted distribution to begin with, have an expert team supporting you, and also have the option to get to FIPS compliance quickly if you need to.Once you have Istio up and running, you will probably need simpler ways to manage and secure your services beyond what’s available in Istio, that’s where Tetrate Service Bridge comes in.

      <title>The Future of Istio: the Path to Zero Trust Security</title>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;In September 2022, Istio &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/09/28/istio-sails-into-the-cloud-native-computing-foundation/&#34; title=&#34;became a CNCF incubation project&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;became a CNCF incubation project&lt;/a&gt;
 and launched the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tetrate-old.local/blog/ambient-mesh-what-you-need-to-know-about-this-experimental-new-deployment-model-for-istio/&#34; title=&#34;Ambient Mesh&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ambient Mesh&lt;/a&gt;
. With CNCF’s strong community and marketing resources, and Ambient Mesh further lowering the barrier to trying Istio, the five year old open source project has been revitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know about service mesh and Istio, or are curious about the future of Istio, this eBook—&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tetrate-old.local/get-insights-into-history-and-future-of-istio-content/&#34; title=&#34;The Current State and Future of the Istio Service Mesh&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Current State and Future of the Istio Service Mesh&lt;/a&gt;
 will give you the answers. The following is an excerpt from the book. In my view, the future of Istio lies in being the infrastructure for zero-trust network and hybrid cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zero-trust&#34;&gt;Zero Trust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero trust is an important topic, including when I spoke at IstioCon 2022. Istio is becoming an important part of zero trust, the most important element of which is identity-oriented control rather than network-oriented control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-zero-trust&#34;&gt;What Is Zero Trust?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero trust is a security philosophy, not a best practice that all security teams follow in the same way. The concept of zero trust was proposed to bring a more secure network to the cloud-native world. Zero trust is a theoretical state where all consumers within a network not only have no authority but also have no awareness of the surrounding network. The main challenges of zero trust are the increasingly granular authorization and the need for a time limit for user authorization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;authentication&#34;&gt;Authentication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istio 1.14 adds support for the SPIFFE Runtime Environment (SPIRE). SPIRE, a CNCF incubation project, is an implementation of the Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone (SPIFFE), also a CNCF Incubation Project. In Kubernetes, we use ServiceAccount to provide identity information for workloads in Pods, and its core is based on Token (using Secret resource storage) to represent workload identity. A token is a resource in a Kubernetes cluster. How to unify the identities of multiple clusters and workloads running in non-Kubernetes environments (such as virtual machines)? That’s what SPIFFE is trying to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of SPIFFE is to establish an open and unified workload identity standard based on the concept of zero trust, which helps to establish a fully identifiable data center network with zero trust. The core of SPIFFE is to define a short-lived encrypted identity document—SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document (SVID)—through a simple API, which is used as an identity document (based on an X.509 certificate or JWT token) for workload authentication. SPIRE can automatically rotate SVID certificates and keys according to administrator-defined policies, dynamically provide workload identities, and Istio can dynamically consume these workload identities through SPIRE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kubernetes-based SPIRE architecture diagram is shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/the-future-of-istio/spire.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/the-future-of-istio/spire.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 1: SPIRE deployed in Kubernetes&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 1: SPIRE deployed in Kubernetes&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istio originally used the Citadel service in Istiod to be responsible for certificate management in the service mesh, and issued the certificate to the data plane through the xDS (to be precise, SDS API) protocol. With SPIRE, the work of certificate management is handed over to SPIRE Server. SPIRE also supports the Envoy SDS API. After we enable SPIRE in Istio, the traffic entering the workload pod will be authenticated once after being transparently intercepted into the sidecar. The purpose of authentication is to compare the identity of the workload with the environment information it runs on (node, Pod’s ServiceAccount and Namespace, etc.) to prevent identity forgery. Please refer to&lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/integrations/spire/&#34; title=&#34; How to Integrate SPIRE in Istio&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt; How to Integrate SPIRE in Istio&lt;/a&gt;
 to learn how to use SPIRE for authentication in Istio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can deploy SPIRE in Kubernetes using the Kubernetes Workload Registrar, which automatically registers the workload in Kubernetes for us and generates an SVID. The registration machine is a Server-Agent architecture, which deploys a SPIRE Agent on each node, and the Agent communicates with the workload through a shared UNIX Domain Socket. The following diagram shows the process of using SPIRE for authentication in Istio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/the-future-of-istio/spire-auth.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/the-future-of-istio/spire-auth.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 2: SPIRE-based workload authentication process in Istio&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 2: SPIRE-based workload authentication process in Istio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steps to using SPIRE for workload authentication in Istio are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To obtain the SIVD, the SPIRE Agent is referred to as a pilot-agent via shared UDS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The SPIRE Agent asks Kubernetes (to be precise, the kubelet on the node) for load information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The kubelet returns the information queried from the API server to the workload validator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The validator compares the result returned by the kubelet with the identity information shared by the sidecar. If it is the same, it returns the correct SVID cache to the workload. If it is different, the authentication fails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please refer to the SPIRE documentation for the detailed process of registering and authenticating workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ngac&#34;&gt;NGAC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When each workload has an accurate identity, how can the permissions of these identities be restricted? Role-based access control (RBAC) is used by default in Kubernetes for access control. As the name suggests, this access control is based on roles. Although it is relatively simple to use, there is a role explosion problem for large-scale clusters—that is, there are too many roles, and the types are not static, making it difficult to track and audit role permission models. In addition, the access rights of roles in RBAC are fixed, and there is no provision for short-term use rights; nor does it take into account attributes such as location, time, or equipment. Enterprises using RBAC have difficulty meeting complex access control requirements to comply with the regulatory requirements that other organizations demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NGAC, or Next Generation Access Control, takes the approach of modeling access decision data as a graph. NGAC enables a systematic, policy-consistent approach to access control, granting or denying user management capabilities with a high level of granularity. NGAC was developed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and is currently used for rights management in &lt;a href=&#34;https://tetrate.io/tetrate-service-bridge&#34; title=&#34;Tetrate Service Bridge (TSB).&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tetrate Service Bridge (TSB).&lt;/a&gt;
 For more information, read our article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://thenewstack.io/why-you-should-choose-ngac-as-your-access-control-model&#34; title=&#34;why you should choose NGAC over ABAC and RBAC&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;why you should choose NGAC over ABAC and RBAC&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hybrid-cloud&#34;&gt;Hybrid cloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practical applications, we may deploy multiple Kubernetes clusters in various environments for reasons such as load balancing; isolation of development and production environments; decoupling of data processing and data storage; cross-cloud backup and disaster recovery; and avoiding vendor lock-in. The Kubernetes community provides a “cluster federation” function that can help us create a multi-cluster architecture, such as the common Kubernetes multi-cluster architecture shown in the figure below, in which the host cluster serves as the control plane and has two member clusters, namely West and East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/the-future-of-istio/federation.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/the-future-of-istio/federation.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 3: Kubernetes cluster federation architecture&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 3: Kubernetes cluster federation architecture&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cluster federation requires that the networks between the host cluster and member clusters can communicate with each other, but it does not require network connectivity between member clusters. The host cluster serves as the API entry, and all resource requests from the outside world to the host cluster will be forwarded to the member clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The control plane of the cluster federation is deployed in the host cluster, and the “Push Reconciler” in it will propagate the identities, roles, and role bindings in the federation to all member clusters. Cluster federation simply “connects” multiple clusters together, replicating workloads among multiple clusters, and the traffic between member clusters cannot be scheduled, nor can true multi-tenancy be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cluster federation is not enough to realize hybrid clouds. In order to realize hybrid clouds in the true sense, it is necessary to achieve interconnection between clusters and realize multi-tenancy at the same time. Tetrate Service Bridge provides a general control plane for multi-cluster management on top of Istio and then adds a management plane to manage multiple clusters, providing functions such as multi-tenancy, management configuration, and observability. Below is a diagram of the multi-tenancy and API of the Istio management plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/the-future-of-istio/tsb.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/the-future-of-istio/tsb.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Figure 4: TSB’s management plane built on top of Istio&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 4: TSB’s management plane built on top of Istio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to manage the hybrid cloud, TSB uses a management plane based on Istio, creates tenant and workspace resources, and applies the gateway group, traffic group, and security group to the workloads in the corresponding cluster through selectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tetrate provides an enterprise-level service mesh management plane that works across clusters, across clouds, and with on-premises deployments, including VMs and bare metal servers. At Tetrate, we are committed to building an application-aware network suitable for any environment and any workload and providing a zero-trust hybrid cloud platform. And we contribute to building needed infrastructure in open source wherever possible; only management-plane-specific functionality is reserved for the commercial software offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure shown below is the architecture diagram of Tetrate’s flagship product, Tetrate Service Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above is just a summary of what we see for the future of Istio. To learn more about the historical motivation for the emergence of the service mesh, the evolution of Istio, and the Istio open source ecosystem, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tetrate-old.local/get-insights-into-history-and-future-of-istio-content/&#34; title=&#34;download the eBook&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;download the eBook&lt;/a&gt;
. This book provides detailed information on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rise of service mesh technology is due to the popularity of Kubernetes, microservices, DevOps, and cloud native architectures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The emergence of Kubernetes and programmable proxies, which laid a solid foundation for Istio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How eBPF can accelerate transparent traffic hijacking in Istio, but cannot replace the sidecar in the service mesh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the future of Istio lies in building a zero trust network based on the hybrid cloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are also numerous illustrations in the book that will help you understand. With the entry of Istio into CNCF and the introduction of the latest Ambient Mesh, we can expect that Istio will be even easier to adopt, and continue to grow in features, capabilities, and community.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.14.x/announcing-1.14/&#34; title=&#34;Istio 1.14&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio 1.14&lt;/a&gt;
 was released in June of this year, and one of the most notable features of this release is support for &lt;a href=&#34;https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/spire-about/&#34; title=&#34;SPIRE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SPIRE&lt;/a&gt;
, which is one of the implementations of &lt;a href=&#34;https://spiffe.io/&#34; title=&#34;SPIFFE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SPIFFE&lt;/a&gt;
, a CNCF incubation project. This article explains what SPIRE means for zero-trust architectures and why you would need SPIRE for authentication in Istio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;authentication-in-kubernetes&#34;&gt;Authentication in Kubernetes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know that Istio was built for and typically runs on Kubernetes, so before we talk about how to use SPIRE for authentication in Istio, let’s take a look at how Kubernetes handles authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at an example of a pod’s token. Whenever a pod gets created in Kubernetes, it gets assigned a default service account from the namespace, assuming we didn’t explicitly assign a service account to it. Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes manages the identity of Pods with Service Accounts and then specifies the permissions of Pods with a Service Account to the Kubernetes API using RBAC. A service account’s token is stored in a secret, which does not include a declaration of the node or pod where the workload is running. When a malicious actor steals a token, they gain full access to the account and can steal information or carry out sabotage under the guise of that user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A token can only be used to identify a workload in one cluster, but Istio supports multiple clusters and meshes, as well as Kubernetes environments and virtual machines. A unified workload identity standard can help here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-introduction-to-spiffe-and-spire&#34;&gt;An Introduction to SPIFFE and SPIRE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPIFFE’s (Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone) goal is to create a zero-trust, fully-identified data center network by establishing an open, unified workload identity standard based on the concept of zero-trust. SPIRE can rotate X.509 SVID certificates and secret keys on a regular basis. Based on administrator-defined policies, SPIRE can dynamically provision workload certificates and Istio can consume them. I’ll go over some of the terms associated with SPIFFE in a little more detail below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPIRE (SPIFFE Runtime Environment) is a SPIFFE implementation that is ready for production. SVID (SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document) is the document that a workload uses to prove its identity to a resource or caller. SVID contains a SPIFFE ID that represents the service’s identity. It uses an X.509 certificate or a JWT token to encode the SPIFFE ID in a cryptographically verifiable document. The SPIFFE ID is a URI that looks like this: &lt;code&gt;spiffe://trust_domain/workload_identifier&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spiffe-and-zero-trust-security&#34;&gt;SPIFFE and Zero Trust Security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of Zero Trust is identity-centric dynamic access control. SPIFFE addresses the problem of identifying workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might identify a workload using an IP address and port in the era of virtual machines, but IP address-based identification is vulnerable to multiple services sharing an IP address, IP address forgery, and oversized access control lists. Because containers have a short lifecycle in the Kubernetes era, instead of an IP address, we rely on a pod or service name. However, different clouds and software platforms approach workload identity differently, and there are compatibility issues. This is especially true in heterogeneous hybrid clouds, where workloads run on both virtual machines and Kubernetes. It is critical to establish a fine-grained, interoperable identification system at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-spire-for-authentication-in-istio&#34;&gt;Using SPIRE for Authentication in Istio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of SPIRE to Istio, we can give each workload a unique identity, which is used by workloads in the service mesh for peer authentication, request authentication, and authorization policies. The SPIRE Agent issues SVIDs for workloads by communicating with a shared UNIX Domain Socket in the workload. The Envoy proxy and the SPIRE agent communicate through the Envoy SDS (Secret Discovery Service) API. Whenever an Envoy proxy needs to access secrets (certificates, keys, or anything else needed to do secure communication), it will talk to the SPIRE agent through Envoy’s SDS API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most significant advantage of SDS is the ease with which certificates can be managed. Without this feature, certificates would have to be created as a secret and then mounted into the agent container in a Kubernetes deployment. The secret must be updated, and the proxy container must be re-deployed if the certificate expires. Using SDS, Istio can push the certificates to all Envoy instances in the service mesh. If the certificate expires, the server only needs to push the new certificate to the Envoy instance; Envoy will use the new certificate right away, and the proxy container will not need to be re-deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The architecture of using SPIRE for authentication in Istio is depicted in the diagram below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/why-istio-need-spire/spire-with-kubernetes.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/why-istio-need-spire/spire-with-kubernetes.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;SPIRE Architecture with Istio&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;SPIRE Architecture with Istio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use StatefulSet resources to deploy the SPIRE Server and Kubernetes Workload Registrar in the spire namespace of the Kubernetes cluster, and DaemonSet resources to deploy a SPIRE Agent for each node. Assuming that you used the default DNS name &lt;code&gt;cluster.local&lt;/code&gt; when you install Kubernetes, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/spiffe/spire/blob/main/support/k8s/k8s-workload-registrar/README.md&#34; title=&#34;Kubernetes Workload Registrar&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Kubernetes Workload Registrar&lt;/a&gt;
 creates identities for the workloads in the Istio mesh in the following format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SPRRE Server:&lt;code&gt;spiffe://cluster.local/ns/spire/sa/server&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SPIRE Agent:&lt;code&gt;spiffe://cluster.local/ns/spire/sa/spire-agent&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes Node:&lt;code&gt;spiffe://cluster.local/k8s-workload-registrar/demo-cluster/node/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes Workload Pod:&lt;code&gt;spiffe://cluster.local/{namespace}/spire/sa/{service_acount}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way, both the nodes and each workload have their own globally unique identity and can be scaled according to the cluster (trust domain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workload authentication process in Istio mesh is shown in the figure below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;workload-attestation.svg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;
         alt=&#34;The workload authentication process in the Istio mesh&#34; width=&#34;30%&#34;data-img=&#34;workload-attestation.svg&#34;
         data-caption=&#34;The workload authentication process in the Istio mesh&#34;
         
         
         
    /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            The workload authentication process in the Istio mesh
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detailed process is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pilot-agent in the sidecar of the workload calls the SPIRE agent via the shared UDS to get the SVID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SPIRE Agent asks Kubernetes (kubelet on the node to be precise) for information about the workload.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The kubelet returns the information queries from the Kubernetes API server to the workload attestor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The attestor compares the results returned by the kubelet with the identity information shared by the sidecar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If they match, returns the SVID to the workload and caches it, if not, the attestation failed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please refer to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/integrations/spire&#34; title=&#34;Istio documentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio documentation&lt;/a&gt;
 to learn how to use SPIRE for authentication in Istio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPIFFE unifies identity standards in heterogeneous environments, which is the foundation of zero-trust networks. In Istio, whether we use SPIRE or not, authentication is not perceptible to workloads. By using SPIRE to provide authentication for workloads, we can effectively manage workload identity and lay the foundation for a zero-trust network.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been more than 5 years since Google, IBM, and Lyft unveiled the Istio open source project in May 2017. The Istio project has developed from a seed to a tall tree in these years. Many domestic books on the Istio service mesh were launched in the two years following the release of Istio 1.0 in 2018. My country is at the forefront of the world in the field of Istio book publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;service-mesh-one-of-the-core-technologies-of-cloud-native&#34;&gt;Service mesh: one of the core technologies of cloud native&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Istio is nearly synonymous with service mesh in China. The development of service mesh, as one of the core cloud-native technologies described by CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation), has gone through the following stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2017-2018: Exploratory Phase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2019-2020: Early Adopter Phase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2021 to present: Implementation on a large scale and ecological development stage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud native technology enables enterprises to design and deploy elastically scalable applications in new dynamic settings such as public, private, and hybrid clouds, according to the CNCF. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs are examples of cloud native technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service mesh has been included to the CNCF definition of cloud native, indicating that it is one of the representative technologies of cloud native. Google is donating Istio to CNCF today, and we have reason to expect that as a CNCF project, Istio&amp;rsquo;s community will be more open, and its future development will be more smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;service-mesh-and-cloud-native-applications&#34;&gt;Service mesh and cloud native applications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud-native development is gaining traction. Despite the frequent emergence of new technologies and products, service mesh has maintained its place as &amp;ldquo;cloud-native network infrastructure&amp;rdquo; as part of the overall cloud-native technology stack throughout the past year. The cloud-native technology stack model is depicted in the diagram below, with representative technologies for each layer to define the standard. Service mesh and other cloud-native technologies complement each other as a new era of middleware emerges. Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime) defines the cloud-native middleware capability model, OAM defines the cloud-native application model, and so on, whereas service mesh Lattice defines a cloud-native seven-layer network model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;model.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;

    /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            Cloud Native Application Model
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-you-need-a-service-mesh&#34;&gt;Why you need a service mesh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a service mesh isn&amp;rsquo;t tantamount to abandoning Kubernetes; it just makes sense. The goal of Kubernetes is to manage application lifecycles through declarative configuration, whereas the goal of service mesh is to provide traffic control, security management, and observability amongst apps. How do you set up load balancing and flow management for calls between services after a robust microservice platform has been developed with Kubernetes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many open source tools, including Istio, Linkerd, MOSN, and others, support Envoy&amp;rsquo;s xDS protocol. The specification of xDS is Envoy&amp;rsquo;s most significant contribution to service mesh or cloud native. Many various usage cases, such as API gateways, sidecar proxies in service meshes, and edge proxies, are derived from Envoy, which is simply a network proxy, a modern version of the proxy configured through the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, the move from Kubernetes to Istio was made for the following reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application life cycle management, specifically application deployment and management, is at the heart of Kubernetes (scaling, automatic recovery, and release).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes is a microservices deployment and management platform that is scalable and extremely elastic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transparent proxy is the cornerstone of service mesh, which intercepts communication between microservices via sidecar proxy and then regulates microservice behavior via control plane settings. The deployment mode of service meshes has introduced new issues today. For service meshes, sidecar is no longer required, and an agentless service mesh based on gRPC is also being tested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;xDS is a protocol standard for configuring service meshes, and a gRPC-based xDS is currently being developed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes traffic management is decoupled with the service mesh. The kube-proxy component is not required to support traffic within the service mesh. The traffic between services is controlled by an abstraction close to the microservice application layer to achieve security and observability features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Kubernetes, service mesh is an upper-level abstraction of service, and Serverless is the next stage, which is why Google released Knative based on Kubernetes and Istio following Istio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;open-source-in-the-name-of-the-community&#34;&gt;Open source in the name of the community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ServiceMesher community was founded in May 2018 with the help of Ant Financial. Following that, a tornado of service meshes erupted in China, and the community-led translation of Istio&amp;rsquo;s official documentation reached a fever pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became aware of a dearth of Chinese resources for systematically teaching Istio over time, so in September 2018, I began to plan and create an Istio book, launching the Istio Handbook open source e-book project on GitHub. I met many friends who are also interested in Istio and service mesh technology in the online and offline events of the community a few months later, with the promotion of service mesh technology and the expansion of the ServiceMesher community. We unanimously agreed to collaborate on an open source Istio e-book, which will compile the community&amp;rsquo;s important writings and experience into a logical text and make it available to the majority of developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of people volunteered and began co-authoring the book in March 2019 under the auspices of the Community Stewardship Council. In May 2020, we created a cloud-native community that incorporated the original ServiceMesher community in order to further promote cloud-native technology and expand the technical knowledge supplied by the community. The scope of community operations has also widened, moving away from service mesh to more extensive cloud-native tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editorial board for this book, which includes me, Ma Ruofei, Wang Baiping, Wang Wei, Luo Guangming, Zhao Huabing, Zhong Hua, and Guo Xudong, was founded in October 2020. We performed further version updates, improvements, and optimizations to this book under the supervision and assistance of the publishing business. This book, &amp;ldquo;In-depth Understanding of Isito: Advanced Practice of Cloud Native Service Mesh,&amp;rdquo; finally met you after many iterations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-this-book&#34;&gt;About this book&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After version 1.5, Istio underwent considerable architectural modifications, and various new or better features were added, including the addition of a smart DNS proxy, additional resource objects, increased support for virtual machines, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is based on the new edition of Istio, and it aims to provide readers with the most up-to-date and comprehensive content possible by following the newest trends in the Istio community. Furthermore, several of the book&amp;rsquo;s authors are front-line development or operation and maintenance engineers with extensive Istio expertise, offering detailed and useful reference cases for the book.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;This article will guide you on how to compile the Istio binaries and Docker images on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;before-you-begin&#34;&gt;Before you begin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we start, refer to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki/Preparing-for-Development-Mac&#34; title=&#34;Istio Wiki&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio Wiki&lt;/a&gt;
, here is the information about my build environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;macOS 12.3.1 Darwin AMD64&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker Desktop 4.8.1(78998)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker Engine v20.10.14&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;start-to-compile&#34;&gt;Start to compile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, download the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/istio/istio&#34; title=&#34;Istio code&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio code&lt;/a&gt;
 from GitHub to the &lt;code&gt;$GOPATH/src/istio.io/istio&lt;/code&gt; directory, and execute the commands below in that root directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;compile-into-docker-images&#34;&gt;Compile into Docker images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the following command to compile Istio into a Docker image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sudo make docker
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compilation will take about 3 to 5 minutes depending on your network. Once the compilation is complete, you will see the Docker image of Istio by running the following command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;$ docker images

      <title>Understanding the Sidecar Injection, Traffic Intercepting &amp; Routing Process in Istio</title>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Updated on May 6, 2022&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on Istio version 1.13, this article will present the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the sidecar pattern and what advantages does it have?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are the sidecar injections done in Istio?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the sidecar proxy do transparent traffic intercepting?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is the traffic routed to upstream?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure below shows how the &lt;code&gt;productpage&lt;/code&gt; service requests access to &lt;code&gt;http://reviews.default.svc.cluster.local:9080/&lt;/code&gt; and how the sidecar proxy inside the reviews service does traffic blocking and routing forwarding when traffic goes inside the &lt;code&gt;reviews&lt;/code&gt; service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/sidecar-injection-iptables-and-traffic-routing/istio-iptables.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/sidecar-injection-iptables-and-traffic-routing/istio-iptables.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Istio transparent traffic intercepting and traffic routing diagram&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Istio transparent traffic intercepting and traffic routing diagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the first step, the sidecar in the &lt;code&gt;productpage&lt;/code&gt; pod has selected a pod of the reviews service to be requested via EDS, knows its IP address, and sends a TCP connection request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three versions of the reviews service, each with an instance, and the sidecar work steps in the three versions are similar, as illustrated below only by the sidecar traffic forwarding step in one of the Pods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sidecar-pattern&#34;&gt;Sidecar pattern&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dividing the functionality of an application into separate processes running in the same minimal scheduling unit (e.g. Pod in Kubernetes) can be considered sidecar mode. As shown in the figure below, the sidecar pattern allows you to add more features next to your application without additional third-party component configuration or modifications to the application code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/sidecar-injection-iptables-and-traffic-routing/sidecar-pattern.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/sidecar-injection-iptables-and-traffic-routing/sidecar-pattern.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Sidecar pattern&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Sidecar pattern&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sidecar application is loosely coupled to the main application. It can shield the differences between different programming languages and unify the functions of microservices such as observability, monitoring, logging, configuration, circuit breaker, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;advantages-of-using-the-sidecar-pattern&#34;&gt;Advantages of using the Sidecar pattern&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When deploying a service mesh using the sidecar model, there is no need to run an agent on the node, but multiple copies of the same sidecar will run in the cluster. In the sidecar deployment model, a companion container (such as Envoy or MOSN) is deployed next to each application&amp;rsquo;s container, which is called a sidecar container. The sidecar takes overall traffic in and out of the application container. In Kubernetes&amp;rsquo; Pod, a sidecar container is injected next to the original application container, and the two containers share storage, networking, and other resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to its unique deployment architecture, the sidecar model offers the following advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abstracting functions unrelated to application business logic into a common infrastructure reduces the complexity of microservice code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce code duplication in microservices architectures because it is no longer necessary to write the same third-party component profiles and code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sidecar can be independently upgraded to reduce the coupling of application code to the underlying platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iptables-manipulation-analysis&#34;&gt;iptables manipulation analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to view the iptables configuration, we need to &lt;code&gt;nsente&lt;/code&gt;r the sidecar container using the root user to view it, because &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt; cannot use privileged mode to remotely manipulate the docker container, so we need to log on to the host where the &lt;code&gt;productpage&lt;/code&gt; pod is located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use Kubernetes deployed by minikube, you can log directly into the minikube&amp;rsquo;s virtual machine and switch to root. View the iptables configuration that lists all the rules for the NAT (Network Address Translation) table because the mode for redirecting inbound traffic to the sidecar is &lt;code&gt;REDIRECT&lt;/code&gt; in the parameters passed to the &lt;code&gt;istio-iptables&lt;/code&gt; when the Init container is selected for the startup, so there will only be NAT table specifications in the iptables and mangle table configurations if TPROXY is selected. See the iptables command for detailed usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only look at the iptables rules related to &lt;code&gt;productpage&lt;/code&gt; below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;$ minikube ssh

&lt;p&gt;The following diagram shows the detailed flow of the &lt;code&gt;ISTIO_ROUTE&lt;/code&gt; rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/sidecar-injection-iptables-and-traffic-routing/istio-route-iptables.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/sidecar-injection-iptables-and-traffic-routing/istio-route-iptables.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;ISTIO_ROUTE iptables rules&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;ISTIO_ROUTE iptables rules&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will explain the purpose of each rule, corresponding to the steps and details in the illustration at the beginning of the article, in the order in which they appear. Where rules 5, 6, and 7 are extensions of the application of rules 2, 3, and 4 respectively (from UID to GID), which serve similar purposes and will be explained together. Note that the rules therein are executed in order, meaning that the rule with the next highest order will be used as the default. When the outbound NIC (out) is lo (local loopback address, loopback interface), it means that the destination of the traffic is the local Pod, and traffic sent from the Pod to the outside, will not go through this interface. Only rules 4, 7, 8, and 9 apply to all outbound traffic from the review Pod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purpose: To pass through traffic sent by the Envoy proxy to the local application container, so that it bypasses the Envoy proxy and goes directly to the application container.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corresponds to steps 6 through 7 in the illustration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Details: This rule causes all requests from 127.0.0.6 (this IP address will be explained below) to jump out of the chain, return to the point of invocation of iptables (i.e. OUTPUT) and continue with the rest of the routing rules, i.e. the &lt;code&gt;POSTROUTING&lt;/code&gt; rule, which sends traffic to an arbitrary destination, such as the application container within the local Pod. Without this rule, traffic from the Envoy proxy within the Pod to the Pod container will execute the next rule, rule 2, and the traffic will enter the Inbound Handler again, creating a dead loop. Putting this rule in the first place can avoid the problem of traffic dead-ending in the Inbound Handler.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 2, 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purpose: Handle inbound traffic (traffic inside the Pod) from the Envoy proxy, but not requests to the localhost, and forward it to the Envoy proxy&amp;rsquo;s Inbound Handler via a subsequent rule. This rule applies to scenarios where the Pod invokes its own IP address, i.e., traffic between services within the Pod.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Details: If the destination of the traffic is not localhost and the packet is sent by 1337 UID (i.e. istio-proxy user, Envoy proxy), the traffic will be forwarded to Envoy&amp;rsquo;s Inbound Handler through &lt;code&gt;ISTIO_IN_REDIRECT&lt;/code&gt; eventually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 3, 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purpose: To pass through the internal traffic of the application container within the Pod. This rule applies to traffic within the container. For example, access to Pod IP or localhost within a Pod.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corresponds to steps 6 through 7 in the illustration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Details: If the traffic is not sent by an Envoy user, then jump out of the chain and return to &lt;code&gt;OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; to call &lt;code&gt;POSTROUTING&lt;/code&gt; and go straight to the destination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 4, 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purpose: To pass through outbound requests sent by Envoy proxy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corresponds to steps 14 through 15 in the illustration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Details: If the request was made by the Envoy proxy, return &lt;code&gt;OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; to continue invoking the &lt;code&gt;POSTROUTING&lt;/code&gt; rule and eventually access the destination directly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purpose: Passes requests from within the Pod to the localhost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Details: If the destination of the request is localhost, return &lt;code&gt;OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; and call &lt;code&gt;POSTROUTING&lt;/code&gt; to access localhost directly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purpose: All other traffic will be forwarded to &lt;code&gt;ISTIO_REDIRECT&lt;/code&gt; after finally reaching the Outbound Handler of Envoy proxy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corresponds to steps 10 through 11 in the illustration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above rule avoids dead loops in the iptables rules for Envoy proxy to application routing, and guarantees that traffic can be routed correctly to the Envoy proxy, and that real outbound requests can be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About RETURN target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may notice that there are many &lt;code&gt;RETURN&lt;/code&gt; targets in the above rules, which means that when this rule is specified, it jumps out of the rule chain, returns to the call point of iptables (in our case &lt;code&gt;OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt;) and continues to execute the rest of the routing rules, in our case the &lt;code&gt;POSTROUTING&lt;/code&gt; rule, which sends traffic to any destination address, you can think of This is intuitively understood as pass-through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the 127.0.0.6 IP address&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IP 127.0.0.6 is the default &lt;code&gt;InboundPassthroughClusterIpv4&lt;/code&gt; in Istio and is specified in the code of Istio. This is the IP address to which traffic is bound after entering the Envoy proxy, and serves to allow Outbound traffic to be re-sent to the application container in the Pod, i.e. Passthought, bypassing the Outbound Handler. this traffic is access to the Pod itself, and not real outbound traffic. See Istio &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/29603&#34; title=&#34;Issue-29603&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Issue-29603&lt;/a&gt;
 for more information on why this IP was chosen as the traffic passthrough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-traffic-routing-process-explained&#34;&gt;The traffic routing process explained&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traffic routing is divided into two processes, Inbound and Outbound, which will be analyzed in detail for the reader below based on the example above and the configuration of the sidecar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;understand-inbound-handler&#34;&gt;Understand Inbound Handler&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of the Inbound handler is to pass traffic from the downstream blocked by iptables to the localhost and establish a connection to the application container within the Pod. Assuming the name of one of the Pods is &lt;code&gt;reviews-v1-545db77b95-jkgv2&lt;/code&gt;, run &lt;code&gt;istioctl proxy-config listener reviews-v1-545db77b95-jkgv2 --port 15006&lt;/code&gt; to see which Listener is in that Pod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;0.0.0.0 15006 Trans: tls; App: istio,istio-peer-exchange,istio-http/1.0,istio-http/1.1,istio-h2; Addr: *:9080 Cluster: inbound|9080||&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;0.0.0.0 15006 Trans: raw_buffer; Addr: *:9080                                                                 Cluster: inbound|9080||&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following lists the meanings of the fields in the above output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ADDRESS: downstream address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PORT: The port the Envoy listener is listening on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MATCH: The transport protocol used by the request or the matching downstream address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DESTINATION: Route destination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Iptables in the reviews Pod intercept inbound traffic to port 15006, and from the above output we can see that Envoy&amp;rsquo;s Inbound Handler is listening on port 15006, and requests to port 9080 destined for any IP will be routed to the &lt;code&gt;inbound|9080||&lt;/code&gt; Cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the last two rows of the Pod&amp;rsquo;s Listener list, the Listener for &lt;code&gt;0.0.0.0:15006/TCP&lt;/code&gt; (whose actual name is &lt;code&gt;virtualInbound&lt;/code&gt;) listens for all Inbound traffic, which contains matching rules, and traffic to port 9080 from any IP will be routed. If you want to see the detailed configuration of this Listener in Json format, you can execute the &lt;code&gt;istioctl proxy-config listeners reviews-v1-545db77b95-jkgv2 --port 15006 -o json&lt;/code&gt; command. You will get an output similar to the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see that the &lt;code&gt;TYPE&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;ORIGINAL_DST&lt;/code&gt;, which sends the traffic to the original destination address (Pod IP), because the original destination address is the current Pod, you should also notice that the value of &lt;code&gt;upstreamBindConfig.sourceAddress.address&lt;/code&gt; is rewritten to 127.0.0.6, and for Pod This echoes the first rule in the iptables &lt;code&gt;ISTIO_OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; the chain above, according to which traffic will be passed through to the application container inside the Pod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;understand-outbound-handler&#34;&gt;Understand Outbound Handler&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because reviews send an HTTP request to the ratings service at &lt;code&gt;http://ratings.default.svc.cluster.local:9080/&lt;/code&gt;, the role of the Outbound handler is to intercept traffic from the local application to which iptables has intercepted, and determine how to route it to the upstream via the sidecar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requests from application containers are Outbound traffic, intercepted by iptables and transferred to the Outbound handler for processing, which then passes through the virtualOutbound Listener, the &lt;code&gt;0.0.0.0_9080&lt;/code&gt; Listener, and then finds the upstream cluster via Route 9080, which in turn finds the Endpoint via EDS to perform the routing action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Route &lt;code&gt;ratings.default.svc.cluster.local:9080&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;reviews&lt;/code&gt; requests the &lt;code&gt;ratings&lt;/code&gt; service and runs &lt;code&gt;istioctl proxy-config routes reviews-v1-545db77b95-jkgv2 --name 9080 -o json&lt;/code&gt;. View the route configuration because the  sidecar matches VirtualHost based on domains in the HTTP header, so only &lt;code&gt;ratings.default.svc.cluster.local:9080&lt;/code&gt; is listed below for this VirtualHost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see that the endpoint address is &lt;code&gt;10.4.1.12&lt;/code&gt;. In fact, the Endpoint can be one or more, and the sidecar will select the appropriate Endpoint to route based on certain rules. At this point the review Pod has found the Endpoint for its upstream service rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article uses the bookinfo example provided by Istio to guide readers through the implementation details behind the sidecar injection, iptables transparent traffic intercepting, and traffic routing in the sidecar. The sidecar mode and traffic transparent intercepting are the features and basic functions of Istio service mesh, understanding the process behind this function and the implementation details will help you understand the principle of service mesh and the content in the later chapters of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/istio-handbook&#34; title=&#34;Istio Handbook&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio Handbook&lt;/a&gt;
, so I hope readers can try it from scratch in their own environment to deepen their understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using iptables for traffic intercepting is just one of the ways to do traffic intercepting in the data plane of a service mesh, and there are many more traffic intercepting scenarios, quoted below from the description of the traffic intercepting section given in the MOSN official network of the cloud-native network proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;problems-with-using-iptables-for-traffic-intercepting&#34;&gt;Problems with using iptables for traffic intercepting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, Istio uses iptables for transparent intercepting and there are three main problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The need to use the conntrack module for connection tracking, in the case of a large number of connections, will cause a large consumption and may cause the track table to be full, in order to avoid this problem, the industry has a practice of closing conntrack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iptables is a common module with global effect and cannot explicitly prohibit associated changes, which is less controllable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iptables redirect traffic is essentially exchanging data via a loopback. The outbound traffic will traverse the protocol stack twice and lose forwarding performance in a large concurrency scenario.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several of the above problems are not present in all scenarios, let&amp;rsquo;s say some scenarios where the number of connections is not large and the NAT table is not used, iptables is a simple solution that meets the requirements. In order to adapt to a wider range of scenarios, transparent intercepting needs to address all three of these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;transparent-intercepting-optimization&#34;&gt;Transparent intercepting optimization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to optimize the performance of transparent traffic intercepting in Istio, the following solutions have been proposed by the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traffic intercepting with eBPF using the Merbridge Open Source Project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/merbridge/merbridge&#34; title=&#34;Merbridge&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Merbridge&lt;/a&gt;
 is a plug-in that leverages eBPF to accelerate the Istio service mesh, which was open sourced by DaoCloud in early 2022. Using Merbridge can optimize network performance in the data plane to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merbridge leverages the sockops and &lt;code&gt;redir&lt;/code&gt; capabilities of eBPF to transfer packets directly from inbound sockets to outbound sockets. eBPF provides the &lt;code&gt;bpf_msg_redirect_hash&lt;/code&gt; function to forward application packets directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handling inbound traffic with tproxy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tproxy can be used for redirection of inbound traffic without changing the destination IP/port in the packet, without performing connection tracking, and without the problem of conntrack modules creating a large number of connections. Restricted to the kernel version, tproxy&amp;rsquo;s application to outbound is flawed. Istio currently supports handling inbound traffic via tproxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use hook connect to handle outbound traffic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to adapt to more application scenarios, the outbound direction is implemented by hook connect, which is implemented as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;hook-connect.svg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;
         alt=&#34;Hook Connect Diagram&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34;data-img=&#34;hook-connect.svg&#34;
         data-caption=&#34;Hook Connect Diagram&#34;
         
         
         
    /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            Hook Connect Diagram
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whichever transparent intercepting scheme is used, the problem of obtaining the real destination IP/port needs to be solved, using the iptables scheme through getsockopt, &lt;code&gt;tproxy&lt;/code&gt; can read the destination address directly, by modifying the call interface, hook connect scheme reads in a similar way to tproxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the transparent intercepting, the  &lt;code&gt;sockmap&lt;/code&gt; can shorten the packet traversal path and improve forwarding performance in the outbound direction, provided that the kernel version meets the requirements (4.16 and above).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Istio Data Plane Pod Startup Process Explained</title>
      <link>https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-pod-process-lifecycle/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2022 19:18:40 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-pod-process-lifecycle/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;This article will explain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sidecar auto-injection process in Istio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The init container startup process in Istio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The startup process of a Pod with Sidecar auto-injection enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following figure shows the components of a Pod in the Istio data plane after it has been started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-pod-process-lifecycle/istio-pod-lifecycle.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-pod-process-lifecycle/istio-pod-lifecycle.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;1200&#34; data-height=&#34;813&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Istio data plane pod&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Istio data plane pod&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sidecar-injection-in-istio&#34;&gt;Sidecar injection in Istio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following two sidecar injection methods are available in Istio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manual injection using &lt;code&gt;istioctl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes-based &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/&#34; title=&#34;mutating webhook admission controller&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;mutating webhook admission controller&lt;/a&gt;
 automatic sidecar injection method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether injected manually or automatically, SIDECAR&amp;rsquo;s injection process follows the following steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes needs to know the Istio cluster to which the sidecar to be injected is connected and its configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes needs to know the configuration of the sidecar container itself to be injected, such as the image address, boot parameters, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes injects the above configuration into the side of the application container by the sidecar injection template and the configuration parameters of the above configuration-filled sidecar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sidecar can be injected manually using the following command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;istioctl kube-inject -f &lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;YAML_FILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; kuebectl apply -f -
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This command is injected using Istio&amp;rsquo;s built-in sidecar configuration, see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io&#34; title=&#34;Istio official website&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio official website&lt;/a&gt;
 for details on how to use Istio below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the injection is complete you will see that Istio has injected initContainer and sidecar proxy-related configurations into the original pod template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;init-container&#34;&gt;Init container&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Init container is a dedicated container that runs before the application container is launched and is used to contain some utilities or installation scripts that do not exist in the application image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple Init containers can be specified in a Pod, and if more than one is specified, the Init containers will run sequentially. The next Init container can only be run if the previous Init container must run successfully. Kubernetes only initializes the Pod and runs the application container when all the Init containers have been run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Init container uses Linux Namespace, so it has a different view of the file system than the application container. As a result, they can have access to Secret in a way that application containers cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Pod startup, the Init container starts sequentially after the network and data volumes are initialized. Each container must be successfully exited before the next container can be started. If exiting due to an error will result in a container startup failure, it will retry according to the policy specified in the Pod&amp;rsquo;s restartPolicy. However, if the Pod&amp;rsquo;s restartPolicy is set to Always, the restartPolicy is used when the Init container failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pod will not become Ready until all Init containers are successful. The ports of the Init containers will not be aggregated in the Service. The Pod that is being initialized is in the Pending state but should set the Initializing state to true. The Init container will automatically terminate once it is run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a detailed YAML configuration for the bookinfo applications, see &lt;code&gt;bookinfo.yaml&lt;/code&gt; for the official Istio YAML of productpage in the bookinfo sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following will be explained in the following terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Injection of Sidecar containers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creation of iptables rules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The detailed process of routing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;apps/v1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Init container &lt;code&gt;istio-init&lt;/code&gt;: for setting iptables port forwarding in the pod&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sidecar container &lt;code&gt;istio-proxy&lt;/code&gt;: running a sidecar proxy, such as Envoy or MOSN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two containers will be parsed separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;init-container-analysis&#34;&gt;Init container analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Init container that Istio injects into the pod is named &lt;code&gt;istio-init&lt;/code&gt;, and we see in the YAML file above after Istio&amp;rsquo;s injection is complete that the init command for this container is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;istio-iptables -p &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;15001&lt;/span&gt; -z &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;15006&lt;/span&gt; -u &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1337&lt;/span&gt; -m REDIRECT -i &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;*&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; -x &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; -b &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;*&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; -d 15090,15020
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s check the container&amp;rsquo;s Dockerfile again to see how &lt;code&gt;ENTRYPOINT&lt;/code&gt; determines what commands are executed at startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-docker&#34; data-lang=&#34;docker&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c&#34;&gt;# ommit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c&#34;&gt;# The pilot-agent will bootstrap Envoy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;ENTRYPOINT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/usr/local/bin/pilot-agent&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see that the entrypoint of the &lt;code&gt;istio-init&lt;/code&gt; container is the &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin/istio-iptables&lt;/code&gt; command line, and the location of the code for this command-line tool is in the &lt;code&gt;tools/istio-iptables&lt;/code&gt; directory of the Istio source code repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;init-container-initiation&#34;&gt;Init container initiation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Init container&amp;rsquo;s entrypoint is the &lt;code&gt;istio-iptables&lt;/code&gt; command line, which is used as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Usage:

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above incoming parameters are reassembled into iptables rules. For more information on how to use this command, visit &lt;code&gt;tools/istio-iptables/pkg/cmd/root.go&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significance of the container&amp;rsquo;s existence is that it allows the sidecar agent to intercept all inbound and outbound traffic to the pod, redirect all inbound traffic to port 15006 (sidecar) except port 15090 (used by Prometheus) and port 15092 (Ingress Gateway), and then intercept outbound traffic from the application container which is processed by sidecar (listening through port 15001) and then outbound. See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/docs/ops/deployment/requirements/&#34; title=&#34;official Istio documentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;official Istio documentation&lt;/a&gt;
 for port usage in Istio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Command analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the purpose of this start-up command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forward all traffic from the application container to port 15006 of the sidecar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run with the &lt;code&gt;istio-proxy&lt;/code&gt; user identity, with a UID of 1337, the userspace where the sidecar is located, which is the default user used by the &lt;code&gt;istio-proxy&lt;/code&gt; container, see the runAsUser field of the YAML configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the default REDIRECT mode to redirect traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redirect all outbound traffic to the sidecar proxy (via port 15001).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the Init container is automatically terminated after initialization, since we cannot log into the container to view the iptables information, the Init container initialization results are retained in the application container and sidecar container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pod-startup-sequence&#34;&gt;Pod Startup Sequence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The startup process of a Pod with Sidecar auto-injection enabled is as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Init container starts first, injecting iptables rules into the Pod for transparent traffic interception.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subsequently, Kubernetes starts the containers in the order in which they are declared in the Pod Spec, but this is non-blocking and there is no guarantee that the first container will be started before the next one is started. &lt;code&gt;istio-proxy&lt;/code&gt; container starts, &lt;code&gt;pilot-agent&lt;/code&gt; will be the PID 1 process, which is the first process in the Linux user space and is responsible for pulling up other processes and handling zombie processes. The &lt;code&gt;pilot-agent&lt;/code&gt; generates the Envoy bootstrap configuration and fork the envoy process; the application container is started almost simultaneously with the &lt;code&gt;istio-proxy&lt;/code&gt; container, and the readiness probe comes in handy to prevent the container inside the Pod from receiving outside traffic before it is ready to start. Kubernetes will perform a readiness check on port 15021 of the &lt;code&gt;istio-proxy&lt;/code&gt; container, and the &lt;code&gt;kubelet&lt;/code&gt; will not route traffic to the Pod until the &lt;code&gt;isito-proxy&lt;/code&gt; has finished booting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the Pod is started, the &lt;code&gt;pilot-agent&lt;/code&gt; becomes a daemon that monitors the rest of the system and provides Envoy with Bootstrap configuration, certificates, health checks, configuration hot reloading, identity support, and process lifecycle management, among other things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pod-container-startup-order-problem&#34;&gt;Pod container startup order problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of Pod startup there is a container startup order problem. Suppose the following situation, the application container starts first and requests other services, when the &lt;code&gt;istio-proxy&lt;/code&gt; container has not finished starting, then the request will fail, and if your application is not robust enough, it may even cause the application container to crash and the Pod to restart. The solution for this situation is to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify the application to add timeout retries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase the start delay of the process in the application container, for example by increasing the sleep time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/attach-handler-lifecycle-event/&#34; title=&#34;postStart&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;postStart&lt;/a&gt;
 configuration to the application container to detect if the application process has finished starting, and Kubernetes will only mark the Pod&amp;rsquo;s state as &lt;code&gt;Running&lt;/code&gt; if the detection is successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article walks you through the process of starting Pods in the Istio data plane, and the issues that arise because of the order in which Pod contenters are started.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Understanding IPTables</title>
      <link>https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/understanding-iptables/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2022 12:18:40 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/understanding-iptables/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;iptables is an important feature in the Linux kernel and has a wide range of applications. iptables is used by default in Istio for transparent traffic hijacking. Understanding iptables is very important for us to understand how Istio works. This article will give you a brief introduction to iptbles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iptables-introduction&#34;&gt;iptables introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iptables is a management tool for netfilter, the firewall software in the Linux kernel. netfilter is located in the user space and is part of netfilter. netfilter is located in the kernel space and has not only network address conversion, but also packet content modification and packet filtering firewall functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before learning about iptables for Init container initialization, let&amp;rsquo;s go over iptables and rule configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following figure shows the iptables call chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/understanding-iptables/iptables.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/understanding-iptables/iptables.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;726&#34; data-height=&#34;1443&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;iptables 调用链&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;iptables 调用链&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iptables&#34;&gt;iptables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iptables version used in the Init container is v1.6.0 and contains 5 tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RAW is used to configure packets. Packets in RAW are not tracked by the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The filter is the default table used to house all firewall-related operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NAT is used for network address translation (e.g., port forwarding).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mangle is used for modifications to specific packets (refer to corrupted packets).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security is used to force access to control network rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: In this example, only the NAT table is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chain types in the different tables are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Rule name&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;raw&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;filter&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;nat&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;mangle&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;security&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;PREROUTING&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✓&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✓&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✓&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;INPUT&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✓&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✓&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✓&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;OUTPUT&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✓&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✓&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✓&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✓&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✓&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;POSTROUTING&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✓&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✓&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;FORWARD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✓&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✓&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✓&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;understand-iptables-rules&#34;&gt;Understand iptables rules&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View the default iptables rules in the &lt;code&gt;istio-proxy&lt;/code&gt; container, the default view is the rules in the filter table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;$ iptables -L -v
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Chain INPUT &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;policy ACCEPT 350K packets, 63M bytes&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt; pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;               destination
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Chain FORWARD &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;policy ACCEPT &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; packets, &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; bytes&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt; pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;               destination
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Chain OUTPUT &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;policy ACCEPT 18M packets, 1916M bytes&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt; pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;               destination
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see three default chains, INPUT, FORWARD, and OUTPUT, with the first line of output in each chain indicating the chain name (INPUT/FORWARD/OUTPUT in this case), followed by the default policy (ACCEPT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a proposed structure diagram of iptables, where traffic passes through the INPUT chain and then enters the upper protocol stack, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/understanding-iptables/iptables-chains.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/understanding-iptables/iptables-chains.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;1333&#34; data-height=&#34;410&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;iptables chains&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;iptables chains&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple rules can be added to each chain and the rules are executed in order from front to back. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the table header definition of the rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PKTS&lt;/strong&gt;: Number of matched messages processed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bytes&lt;/strong&gt;: cumulative packet size processed (bytes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target&lt;/strong&gt;: If the message matches the rule, the specified target is executed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROT&lt;/strong&gt;: Protocols such as TDP, UDP, ICMP, and ALL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;opt&lt;/strong&gt;: Rarely used, this column is used to display IP options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN&lt;/strong&gt;: Inbound network interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OUT&lt;/strong&gt;: Outbound network interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;source&lt;/strong&gt;: the source IP address or subnet of the traffic, the latter being anywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;destination&lt;/strong&gt;: the destination IP address or subnet of the traffic, or anywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a column without a header, shown at the end, which represents the options of the rule, and is used as an extended match condition for the rule to complement the configuration in the previous columns. prot, opt, in, out, source and destination and the column without a header shown after destination together form the match rule. TARGET is executed when traffic matches these rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types supported by TARGET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target types include ACCEPT, REJECT, DROP, LOG, SNAT, MASQUERADE, DNAT, REDIRECT, RETURN or jump to other rules, etc. You can determine where the telegram is going by executing only one rule in a chain that matches in order, except for the RETURN type, which is similar to the return statement in programming languages, which returns to its call point and continues to execute the next rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the output, you can see that the Init container does not create any rules in the default link of iptables, but instead creates a new link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the above brief introduction to iptables, you have understood how iptables works, the rule chain and its execution order.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Sun, 08 May 2022 10:18:40 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-components-and-ports/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;In my last two blogs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/sidecar-injection-iptables-and-traffic-routing/&#34; title=&#34;Sidecar injection, transparent traffic hijacking , and routing process in Istio explained in detail&#34;&gt;Sidecar injection, transparent traffic hijacking , and routing process in Istio explained in detail&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-sidecar-traffic-types/&#34; title=&#34;Traffic types and iptables rules in Istio sidecar explained&#34;&gt;Traffic types and iptables rules in Istio sidecar explained&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave you a detailed overview of the traffic in the Istio data plane, but the data plane does not exist in isolation. This article will show you the ports and their usages for each component of both the control plane and data plane in Istio, which will help you understand the relationship between these flows and troubleshoot them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I will show you a global schematic. The following figure shows the components of a sidecar in the Istio data plane, and the objects that interact with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-components-and-ports/istio-ports-components.webp&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-components-and-ports/istio-ports-components.webp&#34; data-width=&#34;5230&#34; data-height=&#34;2506&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Istio components&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Istio components&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use the &lt;code&gt;nsenter&lt;/code&gt; command to enter the namespace of the &lt;code&gt;productpage&lt;/code&gt; Pod of the Bookinfo example and see the information about the ports it is listening on internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-components-and-ports/sidecar-ports.webp&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-components-and-ports/sidecar-ports.webp&#34; data-width=&#34;1566&#34; data-height=&#34;740&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Istio sidecar ports&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Istio sidecar ports&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the figure, we can see that besides the port 9080 that the &lt;code&gt;productpage&lt;/code&gt; application listens to, the Sidecar container also listens to a large number of other ports, such as 15000, 15001, 15004, 15006, 15021, 15090, etc. You can learn about the ports used in Istio in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/deployment/requirements/&#34; title=&#34;Istio documentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio documentation&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s go back into the &lt;code&gt;productpage&lt;/code&gt; Pod and use the &lt;code&gt;lsof -i&lt;/code&gt; command to see the ports it has open, as shown in the following figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-components-and-ports/product-pod-ports.webp&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-components-and-ports/product-pod-ports.webp&#34; data-width=&#34;2714&#34; data-height=&#34;902&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Productpage Pod ports&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Productpage Pod ports&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that there is a TCP connection established between the &lt;code&gt;pilot-agent&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;istiod&lt;/code&gt;, the port in the listening described above, and the TCP connection established inside the Pod, which corresponds to the figure at the beginning of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The root process of the Sidecar container (&lt;code&gt;istio-proxy&lt;/code&gt;) is &lt;code&gt;pilot-agent&lt;/code&gt;, and the startup command is shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-components-and-ports/sidecar-procecces.webp&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-components-and-ports/sidecar-procecces.webp&#34; data-width=&#34;2768&#34; data-height=&#34;540&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Internal procecces in Sidecar&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Internal procecces in Sidecar&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see from the figure, the PID of its &lt;code&gt;pilot-agent&lt;/code&gt; process is 1, and it forked the Envoy process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the ports it opens in Istiod, as shown in the figure below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-components-and-ports/sidecar-lsof.webp&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-components-and-ports/sidecar-lsof.webp&#34; data-width=&#34;2544&#34; data-height=&#34;760&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Istiod ports&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Istiod ports&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see the ports that are listened to, the inter-process and remote communication connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ports-usage-overview&#34;&gt;Ports usage overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ports can play a pivotal role when you are troubleshooting. They are described below according to the component and function in which the port is located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ports-in-istiod&#34;&gt;Ports in Istiod&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ports in Istiod are relatively few and single-function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9876: ControlZ user interface, exposing information about Istiod&amp;rsquo;s processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8080: Istiod debugging port, through which the configuration and status information of the grid can be queried&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15010: Exposes the xDS API and issues plain text certificates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15012: Same functionality as port 15010, but uses TLS communication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15014: Exposes control plane metrics to Prometheus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15017: Sidecar injection and configuration validation port&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ports-in-sidecar&#34;&gt;Ports in sidecar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the above, we see that there are numerous ports in the sidecar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15000: Envoy admin interface, which you can use to query and modify the configuration of Envoy Proxy. Please refer to&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/operations/admin&#34; title=&#34; Envoy documentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt; Envoy documentation&lt;/a&gt;
 for details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15001: Used to handle outbound traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15004: Debug port (explained further below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15006: Used to handle inbound traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15020: Summarizes statistics, perform health checks on Envoy and DNS agents, and debugs &lt;code&gt;pilot-agent&lt;/code&gt; processes, as explained in detail below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15021: Used for sidecar health checks to determine if the injected Pod is ready to receive traffic. We set up the readiness probe on the &lt;code&gt;/healthz/ready&lt;/code&gt; path on this port, and Istio hands off the sidecar readiness checks to kubelet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15053: Local DNS proxy for scenarios where the cluster&amp;rsquo;s internal domain names are not resolved by Kubernetes DNS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15090: Envoy Prometheus query port, through which the &lt;code&gt;pilot-agent&lt;/code&gt; will scratch metrics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above ports can be divided into the following categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responsible for inter-process communication, such as 15001, 15006, 15053&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health check and information statistics, e.g. 150021, 15090&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugging: 15000, 15004&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the key ports in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;15000&#34;&gt;15000&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15000 is Envoy&amp;rsquo;s Admin interface, which allows us to modify Envoy and get a view and query metrics and configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Admin interface consists of a REST API with multiple endpoints and a simple user interface. You can enable the Envoy Admin interface view in the &lt;code&gt;productpage&lt;/code&gt; Pod using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;kubectl -n default port-forward deploy/productpage-v1 &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;15000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:15000&lt;/code&gt; in your browser and you will see the Envoy Admin interface as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-components-and-ports/envoy-admin.webp&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-components-and-ports/envoy-admin.webp&#34; data-width=&#34;660&#34; data-height=&#34;1158&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Envoy Admin interface&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Envoy Admin interface&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;15004&#34;&gt;15004&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;code&gt;pilot-agent&lt;/code&gt; proxy &lt;code&gt;istiod&lt;/code&gt; debug endpoint on port 8080, you can access localhost&amp;rsquo;s port 15004 in the data plane Pod to query the grid information, which has the same effect as port 8080 below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;8080&#34;&gt;8080&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also forward &lt;code&gt;istiod&lt;/code&gt; port 8080 locally by running the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;kubectl -n istio-system port-forward deploy/istiod &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;8080&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8080/debug&lt;/code&gt; in your browser and you will see the debug endpoint as shown in the figure below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-components-and-ports/pilot-debug-console.webp&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-components-and-ports/pilot-debug-console.webp&#34; data-width=&#34;1080&#34; data-height=&#34;1243&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Pilot Debug Console&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Pilot Debug Console&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is only one way to get the mesh information and debug the mesh, you can also use &lt;code&gt;istioctl&lt;/code&gt; command or Kiali to debug it, which will be more efficient and intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;15020&#34;&gt;15020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Port 15020 has three main usages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aggregating metrics: You can query port 15090 for Envoy&amp;rsquo;s metrics, or you can configure it to query the application&amp;rsquo;s metrics, aggregating Envoy, application, and its own metrics for Prometheus to collect. The corresponding debug endpoint is &lt;code&gt;/stats/prometheus&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performing health checks on Envoy and DNS agent: the corresponding debug endpoints are &lt;code&gt;/healthz/ready&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/app-health&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugging &lt;code&gt;pilot-agent&lt;/code&gt; processes: the corresponding debug endpoints are &lt;code&gt;/quitquitquit&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;debug/ndsz&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/debug/pprof&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following figure shows the debugging information you see when you open &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:15020/debug/pprof&lt;/code&gt; in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-components-and-ports/pprof.webp&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-components-and-ports/pprof.webp&#34; data-width=&#34;1761&#34; data-height=&#34;1080&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;pprof endpoint&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;pprof endpoint&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information in the figure shows the stack information of the &lt;code&gt;pilot-agent&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By understanding the component ports in Istio, you should have a better understanding of the relationship between the components in Istio and their internal traffic. Being familiar with the functions of these ports will help in troubleshooting the mesh.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Traffic Types and Iptables Rules in Istio Sidecar Explained</title>
      <link>https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-sidecar-traffic-types/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 11:18:40 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-sidecar-traffic-types/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;As we know that Istio uses iptables for traffic hijacking, where the iptables rule chains has one called &lt;code&gt;ISTIO_OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt;, which contains the following rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;td&gt;any&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;lo&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;RETURN&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;any&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;any&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;anywhere&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;anywhere owner UID match 1337&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ISTIO_IN_REDIRECT&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;any&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;lo&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;anywhere&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;!localhost owner GID match 1337&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;RETURN&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;any&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;lo&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;anywhere&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;anywhere !owner GID match 1337&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;RETURN&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;any&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;any&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;anywhere&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;anywhere owner GID match 1337&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;RETURN&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;any&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;any&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;anywhere&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;localhost&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ISTIO_REDIRECT&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;any&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;any&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;anywhere&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;anywhere&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sidecar applies these rules to deal with different types of traffic. This article will show you the six types of traffic and their iptables rules in Istio sidecar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iptables-traffic-routing-in-sidecar&#34;&gt;iptables Traffic Routing in Sidecar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following list summarizes the six types of traffic in Sidecar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote service accessing local service: Remote Pod -&amp;gt; Local Pod&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local service accessing remote service: Local Pod -&amp;gt; Remote Pod&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prometheus crawling metrics of local service: Prometheus -&amp;gt; Local Pod&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traffic between Local Pod service: Local Pod -&amp;gt; Local Pod&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inter-process TCP traffic within Envoy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sidecar to Istiod traffic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following will explain the iptables routing rules within Sidecar for each scenario, which specifies which rule in ISTIO_OUTPUT is used for routing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;type-1-remote-pod---local-pod&#34;&gt;Type 1: Remote Pod -&amp;gt; Local Pod&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are the iptables rules for remote services, applications or clients accessing the local pod IP of the data plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote Pod -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;RREROUTING&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;ISTIO_INBOUND&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;ISTIO_IN_REDIRECT&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; Envoy 15006 (Inbound) -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;ISTIO_OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; RULE 1&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt; POSTROUTING&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; Local Pod&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see that the traffic only passes through the Envoy 15006 Inbound port once. The following diagram shows this scenario of the iptables rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-sidecar-traffic-types/remote-pod-local-pod.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-sidecar-traffic-types/remote-pod-local-pod.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Remote Pod to Local Pod&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Remote Pod to Local Pod&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;type-2-local-pod---remote-pod&#34;&gt;Type 2: Local Pod -&amp;gt; Remote Pod&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are the iptables rules that the local pod IP goes through to access the remote service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local Pod-&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;ISTIO_OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; RULE 9&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;ISTIO_REDIRECT&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; Envoy 15001 (Outbound) -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;ISTIO_OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; RULE 4&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;POSTROUTING&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; Remote Pod&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see that the traffic only goes through the Envoy 15001 Outbound port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-sidecar-traffic-types/local-pod-remote-pod.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-sidecar-traffic-types/local-pod-remote-pod.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Local Pod to Remote Pod&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Local Pod to Remote Pod&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traffic in both scenarios above passes through Envoy only once because only one scenario occurs in that Pod, sending or receiving requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;type-3-prometheus---local-pod&#34;&gt;Type 3: Prometheus -&amp;gt; Local Pod&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prometheus traffic that grabs data plane metrics does not have to go through the Envoy proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These traffic pass through the following iptables rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prometheus-&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;RREROUTING&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;ISTIO_INBOUND&lt;/code&gt; (traffic destined for ports 15020, 15090 will go to &lt;code&gt;INPUT&lt;/code&gt;) -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;INPUT&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; Local Pod&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-sidecar-traffic-types/prometheus-local-pod.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-sidecar-traffic-types/prometheus-local-pod.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Prometheus to Local Pod&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Prometheus to Local Pod&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;type-4-local-pod---local-pod&#34;&gt;Type 4: Local Pod -&amp;gt; Local Pod&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Pod may simultaneously have two or more services. If the Local Pod accesses a service on the current Pod, the traffic will go through Envoy 15001 and Envoy 15006 ports to reach the service port of the Local Pod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iptables rules for this traffic are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local Pod-&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;ISTIO_OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; RULE 9&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;ISTIO_REDIRECT&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; Envoy 15001（Outbound）-&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;ISTIO_OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; RULE 2&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;ISTIO_IN_REDIRECT&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; Envoy 15006（Inbound）-&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;ISTIO_OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; RULE 1&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;POSTROUTING&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; Local Pod&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-sidecar-traffic-types/local-pod-local-pod.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-sidecar-traffic-types/local-pod-local-pod.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Local Pod to Local Pod&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Local Pod to Local Pod&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;type-5-inter-process-tcp-traffic-within-envoy&#34;&gt;Type 5: Inter-process TCP traffic within Envoy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Envoy internal processes with UID and GID 1337 will communicate with each other using lo NICs and localhost domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iptables rules that these flows pass through are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Envoy process (Localhost) -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;ISTIO_OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; RULE 8&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;POSTROUTING&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; Envoy process (Localhost)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-sidecar-traffic-types/envoy-internal-tcp-traffic.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-sidecar-traffic-types/envoy-internal-tcp-traffic.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Envoy inter-process TCP traffic&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Envoy inter-process TCP traffic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;type-6-sidecar-to-istiod-traffic&#34;&gt;Type 6: Sidecar to Istiod traffic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidecar needs access to Istiod to synchronize its configuration so that Envoy will have traffic sent to Istiod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iptables rules that this traffic passes through are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pilot-agent&lt;/code&gt; process -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Istio_OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; RULE 9&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; Envoy 15001 (Outbound Handler) -&amp;gt; OUTPUT -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;ISTIO_OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; RULE 4&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;POSTROUTING&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; Istiod&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-sidecar-traffic-types/sidecar-istiod.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-sidecar-traffic-types/sidecar-istiod.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Sidecar to Istiod&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Sidecar to Istiod&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the sidecar proxies that Istio injects into the Pod or installed in the virtual machine form the data plane of the service mesh, which is also the main workload location of Istio. In my next blog, I will take you through the ports of each component in Envoy and their functions, so that we can have a more comprehensive understanding of the traffic in Istio.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What&#39;s New in Istio 1.13?</title>
      <link>https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/what-is-new-in-istio-1-13/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2022 16:43:27 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/what-is-new-in-istio-1-13/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Istio 1.13 is the first release of 2022, and, not surprisingly, the Istio team will continue to release new versions every quarter. Overall, the new features in this release include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for newer versions of Kubernetes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New API – ProxyConfig, for configuring sidecar proxies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved Telemetry API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for hostname-based load balancers with multiple network gateways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;support-for-kubernetes-versions&#34;&gt;Support for Kubernetes Versions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often see people asking in the community which Istio supports Kubernetes versions. Istio’s website has a clear list of supported Kubernetes versions. You can see &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/releases/supported-releases/#support-status-of-istio-releases&#34; title=&#34;here&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
 that Istio 1.13 supports Kubernetes versions 1.20, 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23, and has been tested but not officially supported in Kubernetes 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, 1.19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When configuring Istio, there are a lot of checklists. I noted them all in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tetratelabs/istio-cheatsheet&#34; title=&#34;Istio cheatsheet&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio cheatsheet&lt;/a&gt;
. There are a lot of cheat sheets about configuring Istio, using resources, dealing with everyday problems, etc., in this project, which will be online soon, so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following screenshot is from the Istio cheatsheet website, it shows the basic cheat sheet for setting up Istio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;introducing-the-new-proxyconfig-api&#34;&gt;Introducing the new ProxyConfig API&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Istio version 1.13, if you wanted to customize the configuration of the sidecar proxy, there were two ways to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MeshConfig&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use MeshConfig and use IstioOperator to modify it at the Mesh level. For example, use the following configuration to alter the default discovery port for istiod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;apVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;install.istio.io/v1alpha1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;IstioOperator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;meshConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;	  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;defaultConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;discoveryAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;istiod:15012&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annotation in the Pods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also use annotation at the Pod level to customize the configuration. For example, you can add the following annotations to Pod to modify the default port for &lt;code&gt;istiod&lt;/code&gt; of the workload:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;anannotations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;proxy.istio.io/config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sd&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sd&#34;&gt;    discoveryAddress: istiod:15012&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you configure sidecar in either of these ways, the fields set in annotations will completely override the default fields in MeshConfig. Please refer to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/istio.mesh.v1alpha1/#ProxyConfig&#34; title=&#34;Istio documentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio documentation&lt;/a&gt;
 for all configuration items of ProxyConfig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new API – ProxyConfig&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in 1.13, a new top-level custom resource, ProxyConfig, has been added, allowing you to customize the configuration of your sidecar proxy in one place by specifying a namespace and using a selector to select the scope of the workload, just like any other CRD. Istio currently has limited support for this API, so please refer to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/proxy-config/&#34; title=&#34;Istio documentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio documentation&lt;/a&gt;
 for more information on the ProxyConfig API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, no matter which way you customize the configuration of the sidecar proxy, it does not take effect dynamically and requires a workload restart to take effect. For example, for the above configuration, because you changed the default port of istiod, all the workloads in the mesh need to be restarted before connecting to the control plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;telemetry-api&#34;&gt;Telemetry API&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/istio.mesh.v1alpha1/#MeshConfig-ExtensionProvider&#34; title=&#34;MeshConfig&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MeshConfig&lt;/a&gt;
 customized extensions and configurations in the Istio mesh. The three pillars of observability– Metrics, Telemetry, and Logging– can each be docked to different providers. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/observability/telemetry/&#34; title=&#34;Telemetry API&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Telemetry API&lt;/a&gt;
 gives you a one-stop place for flexible configuration of them. Like the ProxyConfig API, the Telemetry API follows the configuration hierarchy of Workload Selector &amp;gt; Local Namespace &amp;gt; Root Configuration Namespace. The API was introduced in Istio 1.11 and has been further refined in that release to add support for OpenTelemetry logs, filtered access logs, and custom tracing service names. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/telemetry/&#34; title=&#34;Telemetry Configuration&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Telemetry Configuration&lt;/a&gt;
 for details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2021, a member of the Istio community &lt;a href=&#34;https://szabo.jp/2021/09/22/multicluster-istio-on-eks/&#34; title=&#34;reported an issue&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;reported an issue&lt;/a&gt;
 with the EKS load balancer failing to resolve when running multi-cluster Istio in AWS EKS. Workloads that cross cluster boundaries need to be communicated indirectly through a dedicated east-west gateway for a multi-cluster, multi-network mesh. You can follow the instructions on &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/multicluster/multi-primary_multi-network/&#34; title=&#34;Istio’s website&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio’s website&lt;/a&gt;
 to configure a multi-network, primary-remote cluster, and Istio will automatically resolve the IP address of the load balancer based on the hostname.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;istio-1131-fixing-the-critical-security-vulnerabilities&#34;&gt;Istio 1.13.1 fixing the critical security vulnerabilities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istio 1.13.1 was released to fix a known &lt;a href=&#34;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE-2022-23635&#34; title=&#34;critical vulnerability&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;critical vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;
 that could lead to an unauthenticated control plane denial of service attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure below shows a multi-cluster primary-remote mesh where istiod exposes port 15012 to the public Internet via a gateway so that a pod on another network can connect to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/what-is-new-in-istio-1-13/multi-network-mesh.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/what-is-new-in-istio-1-13/multi-network-mesh.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;1299&#34; data-height=&#34;1080&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Multi-network Mesh&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Multi-network Mesh&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When installing a multi-network, primary-remote mode Istio mesh, for a remote Kubernetes cluster to access the control plane, an east-west Gateway needs to be installed in the Primary cluster, exposing port 15012 of the control plane istiod to the Internet. An attacker could send specially crafted messages to that port, causing the control plane to crash. If you set up a firewall to allow traffic from only some IPs to access this port, you will be able to reduce the impact of the problem. It is recommended that you upgrade to Istio 1.13.1 immediately to resolve the issue completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;istiocon-2022&#34;&gt;IstioCon 2022&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/what-is-new-in-istio-1-13/istiocon-2022.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/what-is-new-in-istio-1-13/istiocon-2022.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;1318&#34; data-height=&#34;736&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;IstioCon 2022&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;IstioCon 2022&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, as a committee member for the last and current IstioCon, I call on everyone to register for &lt;a href=&#34;https://events.istio.io/istiocon-2022/&#34; title=&#34;IstioCon 2022&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;IstioCon 2022&lt;/a&gt;
, which will be held online on April 25! It will be an industry-focused event, a platform to connect contributors and users to discuss the uses of Istio in different architectural setups, its limitations, and where to take the project next. The main focus on end-user companies, as we look forward to sharing a diversity of case studies showing how to use Istio in production.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;It’s been more than &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tetrate.io/blog/happy-istio-4th-anniversary-retrospect-and-outlook/&#34; title=&#34;four years&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;four years&lt;/a&gt;
 since Istio launched in May 2017, and while the project has had a strong following on GitHub and 10+ releases, its growing open-source ecosystem is still in its infancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently added support for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tetrate.io/blog/istio-wasm-extensions-and-ecosystem/&#34; title=&#34;WebAssembly extensions&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WebAssembly extensions&lt;/a&gt;
 has made the most popular open source service mesh more extensible than ever. This table lists the open-source projects in the Istio ecosystem as of November 11, 2021, sorted by open-source date. These projects enhance the Istio service mesh with gateways, extensions, utilities, and more. In this article, I’ll highlight the two new projects in the category of extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;slime-an-intelligent-service-mesh-manager-for-istio&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slime: an intelligent service mesh manager for Istio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/slime-io/slime&#34; title=&#34;Slime&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Slime&lt;/a&gt;
 is an Istio-based, intelligent mesh manager open-sourced by NetEase’s microservices team. Based on the Kubernetes Operator implementation, Slime can be used as a CRD manager that seamlessly interfaces with Istio without needing any customization or definition of dynamic service governance policies. This achieves automatic and convenient use of Istio and Envoy’s advanced features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slime addresses the following issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing higher-level extensions in Istio. For example, extending the HTTP plugin; adaptive traffic limiting based on the resource usage of the service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor performance arising from Istio sending all the configurations within the mesh to each sidecar proxy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slime solves these problems by building an Istio management plane. Its main purpose are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to build a pluggable controller to facilitate the extension of new functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to obtain data by listening to the data plane to intelligently generate the configuration for Istio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to build a higher-level CRD for the user to configure, which Slime converts into an Istio configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following diagram shows the flow chart of Istio as an Istio management plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Slime architecture&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific steps for Slime to manage Istio are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slime operator completes the initialization of Slime components in Kubernetes based on the administrator’s configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers create configurations that conform to the Slime CRD specification and apply them to Kubernetes clusters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slime queries the monitoring data of the relevant service stored in Prometheus and converts the Slime CRD into an Istio CRD, in conjunction with the configuration of the adaptive part of the Slime CRD while pushing it to the Global Proxy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Istio listens for the creation of Istio CRDs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Istio pushes the configuration information of the Sidecar Proxy to the corresponding Sidecar Proxy in the data plane.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagram below shows the internal architecture of Slime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-extensions-slime-and-aeraki/slime-internal.png&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-extensions-slime-and-aeraki/slime-internal.png&#34; data-width=&#34;1921&#34; data-height=&#34;1081&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Slime Internal&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Slime Internal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can divide Slime internally into three main components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;slime-boot&lt;/strong&gt;: operator for deploying Slime modules on Kubernetes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;slime-controller&lt;/strong&gt;: the core component of Slime that listens to the Slime CRD and converts it to an Istio CRD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;slime-metric&lt;/strong&gt;: the component used to obtain service metrics information. slime-controller dynamically adjusts service governance rules based on the information it receives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following diagram shows the architecture of Slime Adaptive Traffic Limiting.
&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-extensions-slime-and-aeraki/slime-smart-filter.png&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-extensions-slime-and-aeraki/slime-smart-filter.png&#34; data-width=&#34;1920&#34; data-height=&#34;1081&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Slime smart limiter&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Slime smart limiter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slime dynamically configures traffic limits by interfacing with the Prometheus metric server to obtain real-time monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slime’s adaptive traffic limitation process has two parts: one that converts SmartLimiter to&lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/envoy-filter/&#34; title=&#34; EnvoyFilter&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt; EnvoyFilter&lt;/a&gt;
 and the other that monitors the data. Slime also provides an external monitoring data interface (Metric Discovery Server) that allows you to sync custom monitoring metrics to the traffic limiting component via MDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CRD SmartLimiter created by Slime is used to configure adaptive traffic limiting. Its configuration is close to natural semantics, e.g., if you want to trigger an access limit for Service A with a limit of 30QPS when the CPU exceeds 80%, the corresponding SmartLimiter is defined as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;microservice.netease.com/v1alpha1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aeraki-framework/aeraki&#34; title=&#34;Aeraki&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Aeraki&lt;/a&gt;
 is a service mesh project open sourced by Tencent Cloud in March 2021. Aeraki provides an end-to-end cloud-native service mesh protocol extension solution that provides Istio with powerful third-party protocol extension capabilities in a non-intrusive way, supporting traffic management for Dubbo, Thrift, Redis, and private protocols in Istio. Aeraki’s architecture is shown in the following diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Aeraki architecture&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aeraki architecture, source &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/blog/2021/aeraki/&#34; title=&#34;Istio blog&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio blog&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As seen in the Aeraki architecture diagram, the Aeraki protocol extension solution consists of two components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aeraki&lt;/strong&gt;: Aeraki runs as an Istio enhancement component on the control plane, providing user-friendly traffic rule configurations to operations via CRDs. Aeraki translates these traffic rule configurations into Envoy configurations distributed via Istio to sidecar proxies on the data plane. Aeraki also acts as an RDS server providing dynamic routing to the MetaProtocol Proxy on the data plane. The RDS provided by Aeraki differs from Envoy’s RDS in that Envoy RDS primarily offers dynamic routing for the HTTP protocol, while Aeraki RDS is designed to provide dynamic routing capabilities for all L7 protocols developed on the MetaProtocol framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MetaProtocol Proxy&lt;/strong&gt;: A generic L7 protocol proxy based on Envoy implementation. MetaProtocol Proxy is an extension of Envoy. It unifies the basic capabilities of service discovery, load balancing, RDS dynamic routing, traffic mirroring, fault injection, local/global traffic limiting, etc. for L7 protocols, which greatly reduces the difficulty of developing third-party protocols on Envoy and allows you to quickly create a third-party protocol plug-in based on MetaProtocol by only implementing the codec interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the introduction of MetaProtocol Proxy, if you wanted to use Envoy to implement an L7 protocol to implement routing, traffic limiting, telemetry, etc., you needed to write a complete TCP filter, which would have required a lot of work. For most L7 protocols, the required traffic management capabilities are similar, so there is no need to duplicate this work in each L7 filter implementation. The Aeraki project uses a MetaProtocol Proxy to implement these unified capabilities, as shown in the following figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-extensions-slime-and-aeraki/metaprotocol-proxy.png&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-extensions-slime-and-aeraki/metaprotocol-proxy.png&#34; data-width=&#34;3000&#34; data-height=&#34;1081&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;MetaProtocol proxy&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;MetaProtocol proxy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MetaProtocol proxy, source &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/blog/2021/aeraki/&#34; title=&#34;Istio blog&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio blog&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on MetaProtocol Proxy, we only need to implement the codec interface part of the code to write a new L7 protocol Envoy Filter. In addition, without adding a single line of code, Aeraki can provide configuration distribution and RDS dynamic routing configuration for this L7 protocol at the control plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;make-istio-work-for-all-environments-and-workloads&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Istio work for all environments and workloads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen that NetEase and Tencent are scaling Istio mainly by building Operator. However, this scaling is not enough for multi-cluster management. We know that much of our current infrastructure is transitioning to cloud native or containerized, which means containers, virtual machines, and other environments co-exist. How do we unify traffic management of these different environments? It is possible to do so using Istio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to again build a management plane on top of Istio and add an abstraction layer to add CRDs that apply to cluster management, such as cluster traffic configuration, policy configuration, etc. Additionally, you have to deploy a Gateway in each cluster that connects uniformly to an edge proxy that interconnects all the groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about Tetrate Service Bridge (TSB), which provides this layer of infrastructure, you can go &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tetrate.io/tetrate-service-bridge/&#34; title=&#34;here&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
. TSB is built on the open source Istio with enhancements, it follows the concept of the above two open source projects, and also builds a management plane to support heterogeneous environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, the Istio-based projects and the open source environment are booming and companies like Tetrate are doing useful jobs of productizing and making Istio available to all workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Istio Service Mesh as API Gateway</title>
      <link>https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-servicemesh-api-gateway/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Aug 2021 10:22:00 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-servicemesh-api-gateway/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;API gateways have been around for a long time as the entry point for clients to access the back-end, mainly to manage “north-south” traffic, In recent years, service mesh architectures have become popular, mainly for managing internal systems,(i.e. “east-west” traffic), while a service mesh like Istio also has built-in gateways that bring traffic inside and outside the system under unified control. This often creates confusion for first-time users of Istio. What is the relationship between the service mesh and the API gateway? How does Istio’s gateway work? What are the ways to expose the services in the Istio mesh? This article gives you the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-insights&#34;&gt;Key Insights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The service mesh was originally created to solve the problem of managing internal traffic for distributed systems, but API gateways existed long before it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the Gateway is built into Istio, you can still use a custom Ingress Controller to proxy external traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API gateways and service mesh are converging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-i-expose-services-in-the-istio-mesh&#34;&gt;How do I expose services in the Istio mesh?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following diagram shows four approaches to expose services in the Istio mesh using Istio Gateway, Kubernetes Ingress, API Gateway, and NodePort/LB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-servicemesh-api-gateway/access-cluster.svg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/istio-servicemesh-api-gateway/access-cluster.svg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Exposing services through Istio Ingress Gateway&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Exposing services through Istio Ingress Gateway&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Istio mesh is shaded, and the traffic in the mesh is internal (east-west) traffic, while the traffic from clients accessing services within the Kubernetes cluster is external (north-south) traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;NodePort/LoadBalancer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Load balancing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Kubernetes Ingress&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ingress controller&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Load balancing, TLS, virtual host, traffic routing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Istio Gateway&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Istio&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Load balancing, TLS, virtual host, advanced traffic routing, other advanced Istio features&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;API Gateway&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;API Gateway&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Load balancing, TLS, virtual host, advanced traffic routing, API lifecycle management, billing, rate limiting, policy enforcement, data aggregation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since NodePort/LoadBalancer is a basic way to expose services built into Kubernetes, this article will not discuss that option. Each of the other three approaches will be described below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-kubernetes-ingress-to-expose-traffic&#34;&gt;Using Kubernetes Ingress to expose traffic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know that clients of a Kubernetes cluster cannot directly access the IP address of a pod because the pod is in a network plane built into Kubernetes. We can expose services inside Kubernetes outside the cluster using NodePort or Load Balancer Kubernetes service type. To support virtual hosting, hiding and saving IP addresses, you can use Ingress resources to expose services in Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Kubernetes Ingress to expose services&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that controls the behavior of an ingress controller that does the traffic touring, which is the equivalent of a load-balanced directional proxy server such as Nginx, Apache, etc., which also includes rule definitions, i.e., routing information for URLs, which is provided by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#ingress-controllers&#34; title=&#34;Ingress controller&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ingress controller&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;kubernetes.io/ingress.class: istio&lt;/em&gt; annotation in the example above indicates that the Ingress uses the Istio Ingress Controller which in fact uses Envoy proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-istio-gateway-to-expose-services&#34;&gt;Using Istio Gateway to expose services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istio is a popular service mesh implementation that has evolved from Kubernetes that implements some features that Kubernetes doesn’t. (See &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tetrate.io/blog/what-is-istio-and-why-does-kubernetes-need-it/&#34; title=&#34;What is Istio and why does Kubernetes need Istio?&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;What is Istio and why does Kubernetes need Istio?&lt;/a&gt;
) It makes traffic management transparent to the application, moving this functionality from the application to the platform layer and becoming a cloud-native infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istio used Kubernetes Ingress as the traffic portal in versions prior to Istio 0.8, where Envoy was used as the Ingress Controller. From Istio 0.8 and later, Istio created the Gateway object. Gateway and VirtualService are used to represent the configuration model of Istio Ingress, and the default implementation of Istio Ingress uses the same Envoy proxy. In this way, the Istio control plane controls both the ingress gateway and the internal sidecar proxy with a consistent configuration model. These configurations include routing rules, policy enforcement, telemetry, and other service control functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Istio Gateway resources function similarly to the Kubernetes Ingress in that it is responsible for north-south traffic to and from the cluster. The Istio Gateway acts as a load balancer to carry connections to and from the edge of the service mesh. The specification describes a set of open ports and the protocols used by those ports, as well as the SNI configuration for load balancing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Istio Gateway resource itself can only be configured for L4 through L6, such as exposed ports, TLS settings, etc.; however, the Gateway can be bound to a VirtualService, where routing rules can be configured on L7, such as versioned traffic routing, fault injection, HTTP redirects, HTTP rewrites, and all other routing rules supported within the mesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is an example of a Gateway binding to a VirtualService. The pod with the “istio: ingressgateway” label will act as the Ingress controller and route HTTP traffic to port 80 of the httpbin.example.com virtual host. The biggest difference between this and using Kubernetes Ingress is that it requires us to manually bind the VirtualService to the Gateway and specify the pod where the Gateway is located. This configuration is equivalent to opening up an entry point to Kubernetes for external access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-an-api-gateway&#34;&gt;Using an API Gateway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;API gateways are API management tools that sit between the client and the back-end service and are widely used in microservices as a way to separate the client interface from the back-end implementation. When a client makes a request, the API gateway breaks it down into multiple requests, then routes them to the correct location, generates a response, and keeps track of everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The API Gateway is a special type of service in the microservices architecture that serves as the entry point for all microservices and is responsible for performing routing requests, protocol conversions, aggregating data, authentication, rate limiting, circuit breaking, and more. Most enterprise APIs are deployed through API Gateways, which typically handle common tasks across API service systems, such as TLS termination, authentication and authorization, rate limiting, and statistical information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There can be one or more API Gateways in the mesh. The responsibilities of the API Gateway are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Request routing and version control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitating the transition of monolithic applications to microservices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Permission authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data aggregation: monitoring and billing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protocol conversion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messaging and caching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security and alerting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the above basic functions such as routing and permission authentication can also be achieved through Istio Gateway, but some mature API gateways may be more advantageous in terms of feature richness and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The introduction of API Gateway requires consideration of the deployment, operation and maintenance, load balancing, and other scenarios of API Gateway itself, which increases the complexity of back-end services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An API Gateway carries a large number of interface adaptations, which makes it difficult to maintain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For some scenarios, the addition of a hop may lead to a reduction in performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, some API Gateway imitations are building their own service mesh by deploying them in the sidecar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Istio mesh, you can use a variety of Kubernetes Ingress Controllers to act as entry gateways, but of course, you can also use Istio’s built-in Istio Gateway directly, for policy control, traffic management, and usage monitoring. The advantage of this is that the gateway can be managed directly through Istio’s control plane, without the need for additional tools. But for functions such as API statement cycle management, complex billing, protocol conversion, and authentication, a traditional API gateway may be a better fit for you. So, you can choose according to your needs, or you can use a combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some traditional reverse proxies are also moving towards Service Mesh, such as Nginx with Nginx Service Mesh and Traefik with Traefik Mesh, and some API gateway products are also moving towards Service Mesh, such as Kong with Kuma, and in the future, we will see more convergence of API gateways, reverse proxies, and service meshes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multicluster Management With Kubernetes and Istio</title>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Do you have multiple Kubernetes clusters and a service mesh? Do your virtual machines and services in a Kubernetes cluster need to interact? This article will take you through the process and considerations of building a hybrid cloud using Kubernetes and an Istio Service Mesh. Together, Kubernetes and Istio can be used to bring hybrid workloads into a mesh and achieve interoperability for multicluster. But another layer of infrastructure — a management plane — is helpful for managing multicluster or multimesh deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;kubernetes&#34;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Kubernetes enables rapid deployment of a distributed environment that enables cloud interoperability and unifies the control plane on the cloud. It also provides resource objects, such as Service, Ingress and &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/04/22/evolving-kubernetes-networking-with-the-gateway-api/&#34; title=&#34;Gateway&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gateway&lt;/a&gt;
, to handle application traffic. The Kubernetes API Server communicates with the kube-proxy component on each node in the cluster, creates iptables rules for the node, and forwards requests to other pods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that a client now wants to access a service in Kubernetes, the request is first sent to the Ingress/Gateway, then forwarded to the backend service (Service A in the diagram below) based on the routing configuration in the Ingress/Gateway. Then Service A polls an instance of Service B for the traffic requested by Service B. Lastly, the traffic requested by Service A for Service B is polled forward to Service B’s instance.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;kubernetes-multicluster&#34;&gt;Kubernetes Multicluster&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common usage scenarios for multicluster management include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;service traffic load balancing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;isolating development and production environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;decoupling data processing and data storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cross-cloud backup and disaster recovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flexible allocation of compute resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;low-latency access to services across regions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoiding vendor lock-in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are often multiple Kubernetes clusters within an enterprise; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed&#34; title=&#34;KubeFed&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;KubeFed&lt;/a&gt;
 implementation of Kubernetes cluster federation developed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-multicluster/README.md&#34; title=&#34;Multicluster SIG&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Multicluster SIG&lt;/a&gt;
 enables multicluster management capabilities, which allows all Kubernetes clusters to be managed through the same interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several general issues that need to be addressed when using cluster federation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuring which clusters need to be federated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API resources need to be propagated across the clusters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuring how API resources are distributed to different clusters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Registering DNS records in clusters to enable service discovery across clusters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a multicluster architecture for &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubesphere.io/&#34; title=&#34;KubeSphere&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;KubeSphere&lt;/a&gt;
 — one of the most commonly used Kubernetes multicluster management architectures — where the Host Cluster serves as the control plane with two member clusters, West and East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/multicluster-management-with-kubernetes-and-istio/008i3skNly1gsgg7a2ojvj31aa0u0491.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/multicluster-management-with-kubernetes-and-istio/008i3skNly1gsgg7a2ojvj31aa0u0491.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;1666&#34; data-height=&#34;1080&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Multicluster&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Multicluster&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Host Cluster needs to be able to access the API Server of the Member Cluster, but the network connectivity between Member Clusters is not required. The Host Cluster is independent of the Member Cluster it manages and the Member Cluster is not aware of the existence of the Host Cluster. The advantage of this is that when the control plane fails, the Member Cluster will not be affected and the deployed load can still operate normally without being affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Host Cluster also assumes the role of API portal, and the Host Cluster forwards the resource requests to the Member Cluster — which is convenient for aggregation and also facilitates unified authority authentication. We see that there is a Federation Control Plane in the Host Cluster, where the Push Reconciler propagates the identity, role, and role binding from the Federation Cluster to all Member Clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;istio-service-mesh&#34;&gt;Istio Service Mesh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider using the Istio service mesh when we have multilingual, multiversion microservices running in Kubernetes and need finer-grained canary publishing and unified security policy management for inter-service observability. Istio enables intelligent application-aware load balancing from the application layer to other Service Mesh-enabled services in the cluster, by transparently intercepting all traffic to and from the application using IPTables, and bypassing the primary kube-proxy load balancing. The Istio control plane communicates with the Kubernetes API Server to obtain information about all registered services in the cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following diagram illustrates the basics of Istio, where all nodes belong to the same Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/multicluster-management-with-kubernetes-and-istio/008i3skNly1gsgg6sdrk2j32v60u0qbb.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/multicluster-management-with-kubernetes-and-istio/008i3skNly1gsgg6sdrk2j32v60u0qbb.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;3714&#34; data-height=&#34;1080&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Istio Service Mesh&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Istio Service Mesh&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may end up with at least a few Kubernetes clusters, each hosting microservices. Multiple &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/multicluster/&#34; title=&#34;deployment models&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;deployment models&lt;/a&gt;
 exist for Istio’s multicluster deployments — depending on network isolation, primary and backup — which can be specified by declaration when deploying using Istio Operator. Communication between these microservices in a cluster can be enhanced by a service mesh. Within the cluster, Istio provides common communication patterns to improve resiliency, security and observability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above is about application load management on Kubernetes, but for legacy applications on virtual machines: how can they be managed in the same plane? Istio supports applications on virtual machines, so why do we need a management plane?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;management-plane&#34;&gt;Management Plane&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To manage gateways, traffic and security groupings, and apply them to different clusters and namespaces, you’ll need to add another layer of abstraction on top of Istio: a management plane. The diagram below shows the multitenant model of Tetrate Service Bridge (TSB). TSB uses Next Generation Access Control (NGAC) — a fine-grained authorization framework — to manage user access and also facilitate the construction of a zero-trust network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/multicluster-management-with-kubernetes-and-istio/008i3skNly1gsgg8ndcajj31il0u00z9.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/multicluster-management-with-kubernetes-and-istio/008i3skNly1gsgg8ndcajj31il0u00z9.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;1965&#34; data-height=&#34;1080&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Management Plane&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Management Plane&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istio provides workload identification, protected by strong mTLS encryption. This zero-trust model is better than trusting workloads based on topology information, such as source IP. A common control plane for multicluster management is built on top of Istio. Then a management plane is added to manage multiple clusters — providing multitenancy, management configuration, observability, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagram below shows the architecture of Tetrate Service Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/multicluster-management-with-kubernetes-and-istio/008i3skNly1gsgg951mknj314g0u0dnf.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/multicluster-management-with-kubernetes-and-istio/008i3skNly1gsgg951mknj314g0u0dnf.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;1456&#34; data-height=&#34;1080&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Tetrate Service Bridge&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Tetrate Service Bridge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interoperability of heterogeneous clusters is achieved with Kubernetes. Istio brings containerized and virtual machine loads into a single control plane, to unify traffic, security and observability within the clusters. However, as the number of clusters, network environments and user permissions become more complex, there is a need to build another management plane above Istio’s control plane (for example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tetrate.io/tetrate-service-bridge/&#34; title=&#34;Tetrate Service Bridge&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tetrate Service Bridge&lt;/a&gt;
) for hybrid cloud management.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Debug Microservices in Kubernetes With Proxy, Sidecar or Service Mesh?</title>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Kubernetes is arguably the best environment for running microservices so far, but the experience of debugging microservices in a Kubernetes environment may not be as user-friendly. This article will show you how to debug microservices in Kubernetes, introduce common tools, and explain how the introduction of Istio impacts debugging microservices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;debugging-microservices-is-vastly-different-from-traditional-monolithic-applications&#34;&gt;Debugging microservices is vastly different from traditional monolithic applications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debugging of microservices has been a long-standing problem for software developers. This challenge does not exist in traditional monolithic applications because developers can leverage the debugger in IDEs to add breakpoints, modify environment variables, single-step execution, etc. for their applications, all of which provide great help in software debugging. With the popularity of Kubernetes, the debugging of microservices becomes a thorny issue, where the following issues are more complicated than the debugging of traditional monolithic applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;multiple-dependencies&#34;&gt;Multiple dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A microservice often depends on multiple other microservices, some shared volumes across multiple microservices, and authorizations based on service accounts. When debugging a microservice, how do you deploy other dependent services to quickly build a latest set of staging environments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;access-from-a-local-machine&#34;&gt;Access from a local machine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When microservices are running on a developer’s local computer, there is usually no direct access to the services in a Kubernetes cluster. How can you debug microservices deployed in a Kubernetes cluster as if they were local services?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;slow-development-loop&#34;&gt;Slow development loop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, it takes a long process to update the code and build it into an image before pushing it to the cluster. How do you speed up the development cycle? Let’s look at the tools that address those challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tools&#34;&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main solutions for debugging microservices in Kubernetes are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proxy: by building a VPN, deploying a proxy in the Kubernetes cluster, and adding local debug endpoints to make the services in Kubernetes directly accessible to local applications, your architecture will look like [ local service ] &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; [ proxy ] &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; [ app in Kubernetes ].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sidecar: Inject a sidecar into the pod of the microservice to be debugged to intercept all traffic to and from the service, so that the service can be tracked and monitored, and the service can also be debugged in this sidecar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Service Mesh: To get an overall picture of the application, inject sidecars into all microservices so that you can get a dashboard that monitors global status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are three typical open source projects that implement the above solutions, each of which can help you debug microservices from a different perspective. You can apply them at different stages of software development and they can be said to be complementary to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;proxy--debugging-microservices-with-telepresence&#34;&gt;Proxy – debugging microservices with Telepresence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.telepresence.io/&#34; title=&#34;Telepresence&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Telepresence&lt;/a&gt;
 is essentially a local proxy that proxies data volumes, environment variables, and networks in a Kubernetes cluster locally. The following diagram shows the main usage scenarios for Telepresence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/how-to-debug-microservices-in-kubernetes-with-proxy-sidecar-or-service-mesh/telepresence.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/how-to-debug-microservices-in-kubernetes-with-proxy-sidecar-or-service-mesh/telepresence.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;1080&#34; data-height=&#34;1197&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Proxy mode: Telepresence&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Proxy mode: Telepresence&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users need to manually execute the telepresence command locally, which will automatically deploy the agent to Kubernetes. Once the agent has been deployed,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local services will have complete access to other services in the Kubernetes cluster, environment variables, Secret, ConfigMap, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Services in the cluster also have direct access to the locally exposed endpoints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this approach requires users to run multiple commands while debugging locally, and in some network environments it may not be possible to establish a VPN connection to the Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sidecar--debugging-microservices-with-nocalhost&#34;&gt;Sidecar – debugging microservices with Nocalhost&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nocalhost.dev/&#34; title=&#34;Nocalhost&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nocalhost&lt;/a&gt;
 is a Kubernetes-based cloud development environment. To use it, you just need to install a plugin in your IDE – VS Code to extend Kubernetes and shorten the development feedback cycle. The development environment can be isolated by creating different namespaces for different users and using ServiceAccount when binding to different user corners. Nocalhost also provides a web console and API for administrators to manage different development environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/how-to-debug-microservices-in-kubernetes-with-proxy-sidecar-or-service-mesh/sidecar-nocalhost.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/how-to-debug-microservices-in-kubernetes-with-proxy-sidecar-or-service-mesh/sidecar-nocalhost.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;1928&#34; data-height=&#34;1080&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Sidecar mode: Nocalhost&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Sidecar mode: Nocalhost&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as you have a Kubernetes cluster and have admin rights to the cluster, you can refer to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://nocalhost.dev/getting-started/&#34; title=&#34;Nocalhost documentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nocalhost documentation&lt;/a&gt;
 to quickly start trying it out. To use the Nocalhost plugin in VS Code, you need to configure the Kubernetes cluster in the plugin first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the Kubeconfig file you just exported or copy and paste the contents of the file directly into the configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then select the service you need to test and select the corresponding Dev Container. VS Code will automatically open a new code window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/examples/bookinfo/&#34; title=&#34;bookinfo sample&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;bookinfo sample&lt;/a&gt;
 provided by Istio. You can open the cloned code in your local IDE and click the hammer next to the code file to enter development mode. Selecting the corresponding DevContainer and Nocalhost will automatically inject a development container sidecar into the pod and automatically enter the container in the terminal, as shown in the following figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/how-to-debug-microservices-in-kubernetes-with-proxy-sidecar-or-service-mesh/nocalhost-vs-code.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/how-to-debug-microservices-in-kubernetes-with-proxy-sidecar-or-service-mesh/nocalhost-vs-code.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;1722&#34; data-height=&#34;1080&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Nocalhost VS code&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Nocalhost VS code&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In development mode, the code is modified locally without rebuilding the image, and the remote development environment takes effect in real time, which can greatly accelerate the development speed. At the same time, Nocalhost also provides a server for managing the development environment and user rights, as shown in the following figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/how-to-debug-microservices-in-kubernetes-with-proxy-sidecar-or-service-mesh/nocalhost-web-admin.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/how-to-debug-microservices-in-kubernetes-with-proxy-sidecar-or-service-mesh/nocalhost-web-admin.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;2354&#34; data-height=&#34;1080&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Nocalhost Web&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Nocalhost Web&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;service-mesh--debugging-microservices-with-istio&#34;&gt;Service Mesh – debugging microservices with Istio&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above method of using proxy and sidecar can only debug one service at a time. You’ll need a mesh to get the global status of the application, such as the metrics of the service obtained, and debug the performance of the service by understanding the dependency and invocation process of the service through distributed tracing. These observability features need to be implemented by injecting sidecar uniformly for all services. And, when your services are in the process of migrating from VMs to Kubernetes, using Istio can bring VMs and Kubernetes into a single network plane (as shown below), making it easy for developers to debug and do incremental migrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/how-to-debug-microservices-in-kubernetes-with-proxy-sidecar-or-service-mesh/istio-service-mesh.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/how-to-debug-microservices-in-kubernetes-with-proxy-sidecar-or-service-mesh/istio-service-mesh.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;1956&#34; data-height=&#34;1080&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Serivce Mesh mode: Istio&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Serivce Mesh mode: Istio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, these benefits do not come without a “cost.” With the introduction of Istio, your Kubernetes services will need to adhere to the Istio naming convention and you’ll need to know how to debug microservices using the Istioctl command line and logging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;em&gt;istioctl analyze&lt;/em&gt; command to debug the deployment of microservices in your cluster, and you can use YAML files to examine the deployment of resources in a namespace or across your cluster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;em&gt;istioctl proxy-config secret&lt;/em&gt; to ensure that the secret of a pod in a service mesh is loaded correctly and is valid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of microservicing applications and migrating from virtual machines to Kubernetes, developers need to make a lot of changes in their mindset and habits. By building a VPN between local and Kubernetes via proxy, developers can easily debug services in Kubernetes as if they were local services. By injecting a sidecar into the pod, you can achieve real-time debugging and speed up the development process. Finally, the Istio service mesh truly enables global observability, and you can also use tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tetrate.io/tetrate-service-bridge/&#34; title=&#34;Tetrate Service Bridge&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tetrate Service Bridge&lt;/a&gt;
 to manage heterogeneous platforms, helping you gradually move from monolithic applications to microservices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Is Istio and Why Does Kubernetes Need it?</title>
      <link>https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/what-is-istio-and-why-does-kubernetes-need-it/</link>

        &lt;p&gt;Istio, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/03/04/2019-cncf-survey-results-are-here-deployments-are-growing-in-size-and-speed-as-cloud-native-adoption-becomes-mainstream/&#34; title=&#34;the most popular service mesh implementation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the most popular service mesh implementation&lt;/a&gt;
, was developed on top of Kubernetes and has a different niche in the cloud native application ecosystem than Kubernetes. Rather than introduce you directly to what Istio has to offer, this article will explain how Istio came about and what it is in relation to Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-is-there-an-istio&#34;&gt;Why Is There an Istio?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explain what Istio is, it’s also important to understand the context in which Istio came into being — i.e., why is there an Istio?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microservices are a technical solution to an organizational problem. And Kubernetes/Istio are a technical solution to deal with the issues created by moving to microservices. As a deliverable for microservices, containers solve the problem of environmental consistency and allow for more granularity in limiting application resources. They are widely used as a vehicle for microservices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google open-sourced Kubernetes in 2014, which grew exponentially over the next few years. It became a container scheduling tool to solve the deployment and scheduling problems of distributed applications — allowing you to treat many computers as though they were one computer. Because the resources of a single machine are limited and Internet applications may have traffic floods at different times (due to rapid expansion of user scale or different user attributes), the elasticity of computing resources needs to be high. A single machine obviously can’t meet the needs of a large-scale application; and conversely, it would be a huge waste for a very small-scale application to occupy the whole host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, Kubernetes defines the final state of the service and enables the system to reach and stay in that state automatically. So how do you manage the traffic on the service after the application has been deployed? Below we will look at how service management is done in Kubernetes and how it has changed in Istio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-you-do-service-management-in-kubernetes&#34;&gt;How Do You Do Service Management in Kubernetes?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following diagram shows the service model in Kubernetes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/what-is-istio-and-why-does-kubernetes-need-it/service-model.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/what-is-istio-and-why-does-kubernetes-need-it/service-model.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;1920&#34; data-height=&#34;1200&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Kubernetes Service Model&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Kubernetes Service Model&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the above figure we can see that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different instances of the same service may be scheduled to different nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes combines multiple instances of a service through Service objects to unify external services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes installs a kube-proxy component in each node to forward traffic, which has simple load balancing capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traffic from outside the Kubernetes cluster can enter the cluster via Ingress (Kubernetes has several other ways of exposing services; such as NodePort, LoadBalancer, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes is used as a tool for intensive resource management. However, after allocating resources to the application, Kubernetes doesn’t fully solve the problems of how to ensure the robustness and redundancy of the application, how to achieve finer-grained traffic division (not based on the number of instances of the service), how to guarantee the security of the service, or how to manage multiple clusters, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-basics-of-istio&#34;&gt;The Basics of Istio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following diagram shows the service model in Istio, which supports both workloads and virtual machines in Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/what-is-istio-and-why-does-kubernetes-need-it/istio.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/what-is-istio-and-why-does-kubernetes-need-it/istio.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;1999&#34; data-height=&#34;1104&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Istio&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Istio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the diagram we can see that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Istiod acts as the control plane, distributing the configuration to all sidecar proxies and gateways. (Note: for simplification, the connections between Istiod and sidecar are not drawn in the diagram.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Istio enables intelligent application-aware load balancing from the application layer to other mesh enabled services in the cluster, and bypasses the rudimentary kube-proxy load balancing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application administrators can manipulate the behavior of traffic in the Istio mesh through a declarative API, in the same way they manage workloads in Kubernetes. It can take effects within seconds and they can do this without needing to redeploy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ingress is replaced by Gateway resources, a special kind of proxy that is also a reused Sidecar proxy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sidecar proxy can be installed in a virtual machine to bring the virtual machine into the Istio mesh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, before Istio one could use SpringCloud, Netflix OSS, and other tools to programmatically manage the traffic in an application, by integrating the SDK in the application. Istio makes traffic management transparent to the application, moving this functionality out of the application and into the platform layer as a cloud native infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istio complements Kubernetes, by enhancing its traffic management, observability and security for cloud native applications. The service mesh open source project — launched in 2017 by Google, IBM and Lyft — has come a long way in three years. A description of Istio’s core features can be found in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/#core-features&#34; title=&#34;Istio documentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio documentation&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Service Mesh is the cloud native equivalent of TCP/IP, addressing application network communication, security and visibility issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Istio is currently the most popular service mesh implementation, relying on Kubernetes but also scalable to virtual machine loads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Istio’s core consists of a control plane and a data plane, with Envoy as the default data-plane agent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Istio acts as the network layer of the cloud native infrastructure and is transparent to applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Why Do You Need Istio When You Already Have Kubernetes?</title>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;If you’ve heard of service mesh and tried &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/&#34; title=&#34;Istio&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio&lt;/a&gt;
, you may have the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is Istio running on Kubernetes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the role of Kubernetes and a service mesh in the cloud native application architecture, respectively?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What aspects of Kubernetes does Istio extend? What problems does it solve?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the relationship between Kubernetes, Envoy, and Istio?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will take you through the inner workings of Kubernetes and Istio. In addition, I will introduce the load balancing approach in Kubernetes, and explain why you need Istio when you have Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes is essentially about application lifecycle management through declarative configuration, while a service mesh is essentially about providing inter-application traffic, security management and observability. If you have already built a stable application platform using Kubernetes, how do you set up load balancing and traffic control for calls between services? This is where a service mesh comes into the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Envoy introduces the xDS protocol, which is supported by various open source software, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/&#34; title=&#34;Istio&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio&lt;/a&gt;
, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mosn/mosn&#34; title=&#34;MOSN&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MOSN&lt;/a&gt;
, etc. Envoy contributes xDS to a service mesh or cloud native infrastructure. Envoy is essentially a modern version of a proxy that can be configured through APIs, based on which many different usage scenarios are derived — such as API Gateway, sidecar proxy in service mesh, and edge proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article contains the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A description of the role of kube-proxy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The limitations of Kubernetes for microservice management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An introduction to the capabilities of Istio service mesh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A comparison of some of the concepts in Kubernetes, Envoy, and the Istio service mesh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;kubernetes-vs-service-mesh&#34;&gt;Kubernetes vs Service Mesh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following diagram shows the service access relationship in Kubernetes and service mesh (one sidecar per pod model).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/why-do-you-need-istio-when-you-already-have-kubernetes/008eGmZEly1gpb7knfo4dj31hk0redrz.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/why-do-you-need-istio-when-you-already-have-kubernetes/008eGmZEly1gpb7knfo4dj31hk0redrz.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;1928&#34; data-height=&#34;986&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Kubernetes vs Service Mesh&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Kubernetes vs Service Mesh&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;traffic-forwarding&#34;&gt;Traffic Forwarding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each node in a Kubernetes cluster deploys a kube-proxy component that communicates with the Kubernetes API Server, gets information about the services in the cluster, and then sets iptables rules to send requests for service directly to the corresponding Endpoint (a pod belonging to the same group of services).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;service-discovery&#34;&gt;Service Discovery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/why-do-you-need-istio-when-you-already-have-kubernetes/008eGmZEly1gpb7knwb79j30kq0fcjs9.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/why-do-you-need-istio-when-you-already-have-kubernetes/008eGmZEly1gpb7knwb79j30kq0fcjs9.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;746&#34; data-height=&#34;552&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Service Discovery&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Service Discovery&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istio can follow the service registration in Kubernetes and can also interface with other service discovery systems via platform adapters in the control plane; and then generate data plane configurations (using CRD, which are stored in etcd) with transparent proxies for the data plane. The transparent proxy of the data plane is deployed as a sidecar container in the pod of each application service, and all these proxies need to request the control plane to synchronize the proxy configuration. The proxy is “transparent” because the application container is completely unaware of the presence of the proxy. The kube-proxy component in the process needs to intercept traffic as well, except that the kube-proxy intercepts traffic to and from the Kubernetes node — while the sidecar proxy intercepts traffic to and from the pod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;disadvantages-of-a-service-mesh&#34;&gt;Disadvantages of a Service Mesh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Kubernetes has many pods running on each node, putting the original kube-proxy route forwarding function in each pod will increase the response latency — due to more hops when the sidecar intercepts the traffic — and consume more resources. In order to manage traffic in a fine-grained manner, a series of new abstractions will be added. This will further increase the learning cost for users, but as the technology becomes more popular this situation will be slowly alleviated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;advantages-of-a-service-mesh&#34;&gt;Advantages of a Service Mesh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kube-proxy settings are global and cannot be controlled at a granular level for each service, while service mesh takes the traffic control out of the service layer in Kubernetes by means of sidecar proxy — allowing for more elasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;shortcomings-of-kube-proxy&#34;&gt;Shortcomings of Kube-Proxy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it does not automatically try another pod if the forwarded pod is not serving properly. Each pod has a health check mechanism and when a pod has health problems, kubelet will restart the pod and kube-proxy will remove the corresponding forwarding rules. Also, nodePort-type services cannot add TLS or more complex message routing mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kube-proxy implements load balancing of traffic across multiple pod instances of a Kubernetes service, but how do you do fine-grained control of traffic between these services — such as dividing traffic by percentage to different application versions (which are all part of the same service but on different deployments), or doing canary releases (grayscale releases) and blue-green releases?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kubernetes community gives a way to &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/manage-deployment/#canary-deployments&#34; title=&#34;do canary releases using Deployment&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;do canary releases using Deployment&lt;/a&gt;
, which is essentially a way to assign different pods to a deployment’s service by modifying the pod’s label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;kubernetes-ingress-vs-istio-gateway&#34;&gt;Kubernetes Ingress vs. Istio Gateway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, kube-proxy can only route traffic within a Kubernetes cluster. The pods of a Kubernetes cluster are located in a network created by CNI. An ingress — a resource object created in Kubernetes — is created for communication outside the cluster. It’s driven by an ingress controller located on Kubernetes edge nodes responsible for managing north-south traffic. Ingress must be docked to various Ingress Controllers, such as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx&#34; title=&#34;nginx ingress controller&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;nginx ingress controller&lt;/a&gt;
 and &lt;a href=&#34;https://traefik.io/&#34; title=&#34;traefik&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;traefik&lt;/a&gt;
. Ingress is only applicable to HTTP traffic and is simple to use. It can only route traffic by matching a limited number of fields — such as service, port, HTTP path, etc. This makes it impossible to route TCP traffic such as MySQL, Redis, and various RPCs. This is why you see people writing nginx config language in ingress resource annotations.The only way to directly route north-south traffic is to use the service’s LoadBalancer or NodePort, the former requiring cloud vendor support and the latter requiring additional port management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istio Gateway functions similarly to Kubernetes Ingress, in that it is responsible for north-south traffic to and from the cluster. Istio Gateway describes a load balancer for carrying connections to and from the edge of the mesh. The specification describes a set of open ports and the protocols used by those ports, the SNI configuration for load balancing, etc. Gateway is a CRD extension that also reuses the capabilities of the sidecar proxy; see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/gateway/&#34; title=&#34;Istio website&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio website&lt;/a&gt;
 for detailed configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;envoy&#34;&gt;Envoy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Envoy is the default sidecar proxy in Istio. Istio extends its control plane based on Enovy’s xDS protocol. We need to familiarize ourselves with Envoy’s basic terminology before talking about Envoy’s xDS protocol. The following is a list of basic terms and their data structures in Envoy; please refer to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://envoyproxy.io/&#34; title=&#34;Envoy documentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Envoy documentation&lt;/a&gt;
 for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/why-do-you-need-istio-when-you-already-have-kubernetes/008eGmZEly1gpb7koah95j31450tetta.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/why-do-you-need-istio-when-you-already-have-kubernetes/008eGmZEly1gpb7koah95j31450tetta.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;1445&#34; data-height=&#34;1058&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;Envoy&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Envoy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;basic-terminology&#34;&gt;Basic Terminology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are the basic terms in Enovy that you should know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downstream&lt;/strong&gt;: The downstream host connects to Envoy, sends the request, and receives the response; i.e., the host that sent the request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upstream&lt;/strong&gt;: The upstream host receives connections and requests from Envoy and returns responses; i.e., the host that receives the requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listener&lt;/strong&gt;: Listener is a named network address (for example, port, UNIX domain socket, etc.); downstream clients can connect to these listeners. Envoy exposes one or more listeners to the downstream hosts to connect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cluster&lt;/strong&gt;: A cluster is a group of logically identical upstream hosts to which Envoy connects. Envoy discovers the members of a cluster through service discovery. Optionally, the health status of cluster members can be determined through proactive health checks. Envoy decides which member of the cluster to route requests through a load balancing policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple listeners can be set in Envoy, each listener can set a filter chain (filter chain table), and the filter is scalable so that we can more easily manipulate the behavior of traffic — such as setting encryption, private RPC, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The xDS protocol was proposed by Envoy and is the default sidecar proxy in Istio, but as long as the xDS protocol is implemented, it can theoretically be used as a sidecar proxy in Istio — such as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mosn/mosn&#34; title=&#34;MOSN&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MOSN&lt;/a&gt;
 open source by Ant Group.&lt;/p&gt;

  &amp;lt;figcaption&amp;gt;img&amp;lt;/figcaption&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;
&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/why-do-you-need-istio-when-you-already-have-kubernetes/008eGmZEly1gpb7kk7wk4j31060lqgqx.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/why-do-you-need-istio-when-you-already-have-kubernetes/008eGmZEly1gpb7kk7wk4j31060lqgqx.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;1302&#34; data-height=&#34;782&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;img&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;img&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istio is a very feature-rich service mesh that includes the following capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traffic Management: This is the most basic feature of Istio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Policy Control: Enables access control systems, telemetry capture, quota management, billing, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observability: Implemented in the sidecar proxy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security Authentication: The Citadel component does key and certificate management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;traffic-management-in-istio&#34;&gt;Traffic Management in Istio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following CRDs are defined in Istio to help users with traffic management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gateway: Gateway describes a load balancer that runs at the edge of the network and is used to receive incoming or outgoing HTTP/TCP connections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VirtualService: VirtualService actually connects the Kubernetes service to the Istio Gateway. It can also perform additional operations, such as defining a set of traffic routing rules to be applied when a host is addressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DestinationRule: The policy defined by the DestinationRule determines the access policy for the traffic after it has been routed. Simply put, it defines how traffic is routed. Among others, these policies can be defined as load balancing configurations, connection pool sizes, and external detection (for identifying and expelling unhealthy hosts in the load balancing pool) configurations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EnvoyFilter: The EnvoyFilter object describes filters for proxy services that can customize the proxy configuration generated by Istio Pilot. This configuration is generally rarely used by primary users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ServiceEntry: By default, services in the Istio service mesh are unable to discover services outside of the Mesh. ServiceEntry enables additional entries to be added to the service registry inside Istio, thus allowing automatically discovered services in the mesh to access and route to these manually added services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;kubernetes-vs-xds-vs-istio&#34;&gt;Kubernetes vs. xDS vs. Istio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having reviewed the abstraction of traffic management in Kubernetes’ kube-proxy component, xDS, and Istio, let’s look now at a comparison of the three components/protocols in terms of traffic management only (note that the three are not exactly equivalent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;xDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Istio service mesh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Endpoint&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Endpoint&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;WorkloadEntry&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Service&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Route&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;VirtualService&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;kube-proxy&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Route&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;DestinationRule&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;kube-proxy&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Listener&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;EnvoyFilter&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ingress&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Listener&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gateway&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Service&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Cluster&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ServiceEntry&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;takeaways&#34;&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The essence of Kubernetes is application lifecycle management, specifically deployment and management (scaling up and down, auto-recovery, release).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes provides a scalable and highly resilient deployment and management platform for microservices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A service mesh is based on transparent proxies that intercept traffic between services through sidecar proxies, and then manage the behavior of them through control plane configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A service mesh decouples traffic management from Kubernetes, eliminating the need for a kube-proxy component to support traffic within service mesh; and managing inter-service traffic, security and observability by providing an abstraction closer to the microservice application layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;xDS is one of the protocol standards for service mesh configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A service mesh is a higher-level abstraction of service in Kubernetes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the object managed by Kubernetes is a pod, then the object managed in service mesh is a service, so it’s just a matter of using Kubernetes to manage microservices and then applying service mesh. If you don’t even want to manage a service, then use a serverless platform like &lt;a href=&#34;https://knative.dev/&#34; title=&#34;Knative&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Knative&lt;/a&gt;
 — but that’s an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/istio-1-8-a-smart-dns-proxy-takes-support-for-virtual-machines-a-step-further/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;1.8 is the last version of Istio to be released in 2020 and it has the following major updates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports installation and upgrades using Helm 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mixer was officially removed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added Istio DNS proxy to transparently intercept DNS queries from applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WorkloadGroup has been added to simplify the integration of virtual machines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WorkloadGroup is a new API object. It is intended to be used with non-Kubernetes workloads like Virtual Machines and is meant to mimic the existing sidecar injection and deployment specification model used for Kubernetes workloads to bootstrap Istio proxies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installation-and-upgrades&#34;&gt;Installation and Upgrades&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istio starts to officially support the use of &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/helm/&#34; title=&#34;Helm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt;
 v3 for installations and upgrades. In previous versions, the installation was done with the istioctl command-line tool or Operator. With version 1.8, Istio supports in-place and canary upgrades with Helm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;enhancing-istios-usability&#34;&gt;Enhancing Istio’s Usability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The istioctl command-line tool has a new bug reporting feature (&lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/commands/istioctl/#istioctl-bug-report&#34; title=&#34;istioctl bug-report&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;istioctl bug-report&lt;/a&gt;
), which can be used to collect debugging information and get cluster status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to install the &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/blog/2020/addon-rework/&#34; title=&#34;add-on&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;add-on&lt;/a&gt;
 has changed: 1.7 istioctl is no longer recommended and has been removed in 1.8, to help solve the problem of add-on lagging upstream and to make it easier to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tetrate is an enterprise service mesh company. Our flagship product, TSB, enables customers to bridge their workloads across bare metal, VMs, K8s, &amp;amp; cloud at the application layer and provide a resilient, feature-rich service mesh fabric powered by Istio, Envoy, and Apache SkyWalking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixer, the Istio component that had been responsible for policy controls and telemetry collection, has been removed. Its functionalities are now being served by the Envoy proxies. For extensibility, service mesh experts recommend using &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/blog/2020/wasm-announce/&#34; title=&#34;WebAssembly&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WebAssembly&lt;/a&gt;
 (Wasm) to extend Envoy; and you can also try the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.getenvoy.io/reference/getenvoy_extension_toolkit_reference/&#34; title=&#34;GetEnvoy Toolkit&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GetEnvoy Toolkit&lt;/a&gt;
, which makes it easier for developers to create Wasm extensions for Envoy. If you still want to use Mixer, you must use version 1.7 or older. Mixer continued receiving bug fixes and security fixes until Istio 1.7. Many features supported by Mixer have alternatives as specified in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://tinyurl.com/mixer-deprecation&#34; title=&#34;Mixer Deprecation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Mixer Deprecation&lt;/a&gt;
 document, including the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/istio/proxy/tree/master/extensions&#34; title=&#34;in-proxy extensions&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;in-proxy extensions&lt;/a&gt;
 based on the Wasm sandbox API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;support-for-virtual-machines&#34;&gt;Support for Virtual Machines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istio’s recent upgrades have steadily focused on making virtual machines first-class citizens in the mesh. &lt;a href=&#34;https://thenewstack.io/how-to-integrate-virtual-machines-into-istio-service-mesh/&#34; title=&#34;Istio 1.7 made progress to support virtual machines&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio 1.7 made progress to support virtual machines&lt;/a&gt;
 and Istio 1.8 adds a &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/blog/2020/dns-proxy/&#34; title=&#34;smart DNS proxy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;smart DNS proxy&lt;/a&gt;
, which is an Istio sidecar agent written in Go. The Istio agent on the sidecar will come with a cache that is dynamically programmed by Istiod DNS Proxy. DNS queries from applications are transparently intercepted and served by an Istio proxy in a pod or VM that intelligently responds to DNS query requests, enabling seamless multicluster access from virtual machines to the service mesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istio 1.8 adds a &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/workload-group/&#34; title=&#34;WorkloadGroup&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WorkloadGroup&lt;/a&gt;
, which describes a collection of workload instances. It provides a specification that the workload instances can use to bootstrap their proxies, including the metadata and identity. It is only intended to be used with non-k8s workloads like Virtual Machines, and is meant to mimic the existing sidecar injection and deployment specification model used for Kubernetes workloads to bootstrap Istio proxies. Using WorkloadGroups, Istio has started to help automate VM registration with &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/virtual-machine/#create-files-to-transfer-to-the-virtual-machine&#34; title=&#34;istioctl experimental workload group&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;istioctl experimental workload group&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tetrate.io/&#34; title=&#34;Tetrate&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tetrate&lt;/a&gt;
, the enterprise service mesh company, uses these &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tetrate.io/blog/whats-new-in-istio-1-8-dns-proxy-helps-expand-mesh-to-vms-and-multicluster/&#34; title=&#34;VM features&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;VM features&lt;/a&gt;
 extensively in customers’ multicluster deployments, to enable sidecars to resolve DNS for hosts exposed at ingress gateways of all the clusters in a mesh; and to access them over mutual TLS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, the Istio team has kept the promise made at the beginning of the year to maintain a regular release cadence of one release every three months since the 1.1 release in 2018, with continuous optimizations in performance and user experience for a seamless experience of brownfield and greenfield apps on Istio. We look forward to more progress from Istio in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Integrate Virtual Machines Into Istio Service Mesh</title>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/&#34; title=&#34;Istio&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio&lt;/a&gt;
 is a popular service mesh to connect, secure, control, and observe services. When it was first introduced as open source in 2017, Kubernetes was winning the container orchestration battle and Istio answered the needs of organizations moving to microservices. Although Istio claims to support heterogeneous environments such as Nomad, Consul, Eureka, Cloud Foundry, Mesos, etc., in reality, it has always worked best with Kubernetes — on which its service discovery is based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istio was criticized for a number of issues early in its development, for the large number of components, the complexity of installation and maintenance, the difficulty of debugging, a steep learning curve due to the introduction of too many new concepts and objects (up to 50 CRDs), and the impact of Mixer components on performance. But these issues are gradually being overcome by the Istio team. As you can see from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/zh/blog/2020/tradewinds-2020/&#34; title=&#34;roadmap&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;roadmap&lt;/a&gt;
 released in early 2020, Istio has come a long way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better integration of VM-based workloads into the mesh is a major focus for the Istio team this year. Tetrate also offers seamless multicloud connectivity, security, and observability, including for VMs, via its product &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tetrate.io/tetrate-service-bridge/&#34; title=&#34;Tetrate Service Bridge&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tetrate Service Bridge&lt;/a&gt;
. This article will take you through why Istio needs to integrate with virtual machines and how you can do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-should-istio-support-virtual-machines&#34;&gt;Why Should Istio Support Virtual Machines?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although containers and Kubernetes are now widely used, there are still many services deployed on virtual machines and APIs outside of the Kubernetes cluster that needs to be managed by Istio mesh. It’s a huge challenge to unify the management of the brownfield environment with the greenfield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-needed-to-add-vms-to-the-mesh&#34;&gt;What Is Needed to Add VMs to the Mesh?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the “how,” I’ll describe &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is needed to add virtual machines to the mesh. There are a couple of things that Istio must know when supporting virtual machine traffic: which VMs have services that should be part of the mesh, and how to reach the VMs. Each VM also needs an identity, in order to communicate securely with the rest of the mesh. These requirements could work with Kubernetes CRDs, as well as a full-blown Service Registry like Consul. And the service account based identity bootstrapping could work as a mechanism for assigning workload identities to VMs that do not have a platform identity. For VMs that do have a platform identity (like EC2, GCP, Azure, etc.), work is underway in Istio to exchange the platform identity with a Kubernetes identity for ease of setting up mTLS communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-istio-support-virtual-machines&#34;&gt;How Does Istio Support Virtual Machines?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istio’s support for virtual machines starts with its service registry mechanism. The information about services and instances in the Istio mesh comes from Istio’s service registries, which up to this point have only looked at or tracked pods. In newer versions, Istio now has resource types to track and watch VMs. The sidecars inside the mesh cannot observe and control traffic to services outside the mesh, because they do not have any information about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Istio community and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tetrate.io/&#34; title=&#34;Tetrate&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tetrate&lt;/a&gt;
 have done a lot of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tetrate.io/blog/istio-bringing-vms-into-the-mesh-with-cynthia-coan/&#34; title=&#34;work&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt;
 on Istio’s support for virtual machines. The 1.6 release included the addition of WorkloadEntry, which allows you to describe a VM exactly as you would a host running in Kubernetes. In 1.7, the release started to add the foundations for bootstrapping VMs into the mesh automatically through tokens, with Istio doing the heavy lifting. Istio 1.8 will debut another abstraction called WorkloadGroup, which is similar to a Kubernetes Deployment object — but for VMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following diagram shows how Istio models services in the mesh. The predominant source of information comes from a platform service registry like Kubernetes, or a system like Consul. In addition, the ServiceEntry serves as a user-defined service registry, modeling services on VMs or external services outside the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mx-auto text-center&#34;&gt;
  
  
  
  
    
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimmysong.io/en/blog/how-to-integrate-virtual-machines-into-istio-service-mesh/0081Kckwgy1gkp0fvr3orj30p30ehabc.jpg&#34; data-img=&#34;/en/blog/how-to-integrate-virtual-machines-into-istio-service-mesh/0081Kckwgy1gkp0fvr3orj30p30ehabc.jpg&#34; data-width=&#34;903&#34; data-height=&#34;521&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-caption=&#34;&#34;&gt;
    
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why install Istio in a virtual machine when you can just use ServiceEntry to bring in the services in the VMs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using ServiceEntry, you can enable services inside the mesh to discover and access external services; and in addition, manage the traffic to those external services. In conjunction with VirtualService, you can also configure access rules for the corresponding external service — such as request timeouts, fault injection, etc. — to enable controlled access to the specified external service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, it only controls the traffic on the client-side, not access to the introduced external service to other services. That is, it cannot control the behavior of the service as the call initiator. Deploying sidecars in a virtual machine and introducing the virtual machine workload via workload selector allows the virtual machine to be managed indiscriminately, like a pod in Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;future&#34;&gt;Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/docs/examples/virtual-machines/bookinfo/&#34; title=&#34;bookinfo demo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;bookinfo demo&lt;/a&gt;
, there is too much manual work involved in the process and it’s easy to go wrong. In the future, Istio will improve VM testing to be realistic, automate bootstrapping based on platform identity, improve DNS support and istioctl debugging, and more. You can follow the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/WORKING-GROUPS.md&#34; title=&#34;Istio Environment Working Group&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio Environment Working Group&lt;/a&gt;
