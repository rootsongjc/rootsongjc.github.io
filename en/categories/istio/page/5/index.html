What are the ways to expose the services in the Istio mesh? This article gives you the answer.', '\nAPI gateways have been around for a long time as the entry point for clients to access the back-end, mainly to manage “north-south” traffic, In recent years, service mesh architectures have become popular, mainly for managing internal systems,(i.e. “east-west” traffic), while a service mesh like Istio also has built-in gateways that bring traffic inside and outside the system under unified control. This often creates confusion for first-time users of Istio. What is the relationship between the service mesh and the API gateway? How does Istio’s gateway work? What are the ways to expose the services in the Istio mesh? This article gives you the answer.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n- The service mesh was originally created to solve the problem of managing internal traffic for distributed systems, but API gateways existed long before it.\n- While the Gateway is built into Istio, you can still use a custom Ingress Controller to proxy external traffic.\n- API gateways and service mesh are converging.\n\n## How do I expose services in the Istio mesh?\n\nThe following diagram shows four approaches to expose services in the Istio mesh using Istio Gateway, Kubernetes Ingress, API Gateway, and NodePort\/LB.\n\n![Exposing services through Istio Ingress Gateway](access-cluster.svg)\n\nThe Istio mesh is shaded, and the traffic in the mesh is internal (east-west) traffic, while the traffic from clients accessing services within the Kubernetes cluster is external (north-south) traffic. \n\n| **Approach**          | **Controller**     | **Features**                                                 |\n| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| NodePort\/LoadBalancer | Kubernetes         | Load balancing                                               |\n| Kubernetes Ingress    | Ingress controller | Load balancing, TLS, virtual host, traffic routing           |\n| Istio Gateway         | Istio              | Load balancing, TLS, virtual host, advanced traffic routing, other advanced Istio features |\n| API Gateway           | API Gateway        | Load balancing, TLS, virtual host, advanced traffic routing, API lifecycle management, billing, rate limiting, policy enforcement, data aggregation |\n\nSince NodePort\/LoadBalancer is a basic way to expose services built into Kubernetes, this article will not discuss that option. Each of the other three approaches will be described below.\n\n## Using Kubernetes Ingress to expose traffic\n\nWe all know that clients of a Kubernetes cluster cannot directly access the IP address of a pod because the pod is in a network plane built into Kubernetes. We can expose services inside Kubernetes outside the cluster using NodePort or Load Balancer Kubernetes service type. To support virtual hosting, hiding and saving IP addresses, you can use Ingress resources to expose services in Kubernetes.\n\n![Kubernetes Ingress to expose services](ingress.svg)\n\nIngress is a Kubernetes resource that controls the behavior of an ingress controller that does the traffic touring, which is the equivalent of a load-balanced directional proxy server such as Nginx, Apache, etc., which also includes rule definitions, i.e., routing information for URLs, which is provided by the [Ingress controller](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/concepts\/services-networking\/ingress\/#ingress-controllers).\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io\/v1beta1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io\/ingress.class: istio\n  name: ingress\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - host: httpbin.example.com\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: \/status\/*\n        backend:\n          serviceName: httpbin\n          servicePort: 8000\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThe *kubernetes.io\/ingress.class: istio* annotation in the example above indicates that the Ingress uses the Istio Ingress Controller which in fact uses Envoy proxy. \n\n## Using Istio Gateway to expose services\n\nIstio is a popular service mesh implementation that has evolved from Kubernetes that implements some features that Kubernetes doesn’t. (See [What is Istio and why does Kubernetes need Istio?](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/blog\/what-is-istio-and-why-does-kubernetes-need-it\/)) It makes traffic management transparent to the application, moving this functionality from the application to the platform layer and becoming a cloud-native infrastructure.\n\nIstio used Kubernetes Ingress as the traffic portal in versions prior to Istio 0.8, where Envoy was used as the Ingress Controller. From Istio 0.8 and later, Istio created the Gateway object. Gateway and VirtualService are used to represent the configuration model of Istio Ingress, and the default implementation of Istio Ingress uses the same Envoy proxy. In this way, the Istio control plane controls both the ingress gateway and the internal sidecar proxy with a consistent configuration model. These configurations include routing rules, policy enforcement, telemetry, and other service control functions.\n\nThe Istio Gateway resources function similarly to the Kubernetes Ingress in that it is responsible for north-south traffic to and from the cluster. The Istio Gateway acts as a load balancer to carry connections to and from the edge of the service mesh. The specification describes a set of open ports and the protocols used by those ports, as well as the SNI configuration for load balancing, etc.\n\nThe Istio Gateway resource itself can only be configured for L4 through L6, such as exposed ports, TLS settings, etc.; however, the Gateway can be bound to a VirtualService, where routing rules can be configured on L7, such as versioned traffic routing, fault injection, HTTP redirects, HTTP rewrites, and all other routing rules supported within the mesh.\n\nBelow is an example of a Gateway binding to a VirtualService. The pod with the “istio: ingressgateway” label will act as the Ingress controller and route HTTP traffic to port 80 of the httpbin.example.com virtual host. The biggest difference between this and using Kubernetes Ingress is that it requires us to manually bind the VirtualService to the Gateway and specify the pod where the Gateway is located. This configuration is equivalent to opening up an entry point to Kubernetes for external access.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: networking.istio.io\/v1alpha3\nkind: Gateway\nmetadata:\n  name: httpbin-gateway\nspec:\n  selector:\n    istio: ingressgateway\n  servers:\n  - port:\n      number: 80\n      name: http\n      protocol: HTTP\n    hosts:\n    - \u0022httpbin.example.com\u0022\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThe VirtualService below is bound to the gateway above via *gateways* to accept traffic from that gateway.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: networking.istio.io\/v1alpha3\nkind: VirtualService\nmetadata:\n  name: httpbin\nspec:\n  hosts:\n  - \u0022httpbin.example.com\u0022\n  gateways:\n  - httpbin-gateway\n  http:\n  - match:\n    - uri:\n        prefix: \/status\n    route:\n    - destination:\n        port:\n          number: 8000\n        host: httpbin\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## Using an API Gateway\n\nAPI gateways are API management tools that sit between the client and the back-end service and are widely used in microservices as a way to separate the client interface from the back-end implementation. When a client makes a request, the API gateway breaks it down into multiple requests, then routes them to the correct location, generates a response, and keeps track of everything. \n\nThe API Gateway is a special type of service in the microservices architecture that serves as the entry point for all microservices and is responsible for performing routing requests, protocol conversions, aggregating data, authentication, rate limiting, circuit breaking, and more. Most enterprise APIs are deployed through API Gateways, which typically handle common tasks across API service systems, such as TLS termination, authentication and authorization, rate limiting, and statistical information.\n\nThere can be one or more API Gateways in the mesh. The responsibilities of the API Gateway are\n\n- Request routing and version control\n- Facilitating the transition of monolithic applications to microservices\n- Permission authentication\n- Data aggregation: monitoring and billing\n- Protocol conversion\n- Messaging and caching\n- Security and alerting\n\nMany of the above basic functions such as routing and permission authentication can also be achieved through Istio Gateway, but some mature API gateways may be more advantageous in terms of feature richness and scalability.\n\n- The introduction of API Gateway requires consideration of the deployment, operation and maintenance, load balancing, and other scenarios of API Gateway itself, which increases the complexity of back-end services.\n- An API Gateway carries a large number of interface adaptations, which makes it difficult to maintain.\n- For some scenarios, the addition of a hop may lead to a reduction in performance.\n\nCurrently, some API Gateway imitations are building their own service mesh by deploying them in the sidecar.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn the Istio mesh, you can use a variety of Kubernetes Ingress Controllers to act as entry gateways, but of course, you can also use Istio’s built-in Istio Gateway directly, for policy control, traffic management, and usage monitoring. The advantage of this is that the gateway can be managed directly through Istio’s control plane, without the need for additional tools. But for functions such as API statement cycle management, complex billing, protocol conversion, and authentication, a traditional API gateway may be a better fit for you. So, you can choose according to your needs, or you can use a combination.\n\nSome traditional reverse proxies are also moving towards Service Mesh, such as Nginx with Nginx Service Mesh and Traefik with Traefik Mesh, and some API gateway products are also moving towards Service Mesh, such as Kong with Kuma, and in the future, we will see more convergence of API gateways, reverse proxies, and service meshes.\n', '\/en\/blog\/istio-servicemesh-api-gateway\/')">

Do your virtual machines and services in a Kubernetes cluster need to interact? This article will take you through the process and considerations of building a hybrid cloud using Kubernetes and an Istio Service Mesh. Together, Kubernetes and Istio can be used to bring hybrid workloads into a mesh and achieve interoperability for multicluster. But another layer of infrastructure — a management plane — is helpful for managing multicluster or multimesh deployments.\n\n## Kubernetes\n\nUsing Kubernetes enables rapid deployment of a distributed environment that enables cloud interoperability and unifies the control plane on the cloud. It also provides resource objects, such as Service, Ingress and [Gateway](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/blog\/2021\/04\/22\/evolving-kubernetes-networking-with-the-gateway-api\/), to handle application traffic. The Kubernetes API Server communicates with the kube-proxy component on each node in the cluster, creates iptables rules for the node, and forwards requests to other pods.\n\nAssuming that a client now wants to access a service in Kubernetes, the request is first sent to the Ingress\/Gateway, then forwarded to the backend service (Service A in the diagram below) based on the routing configuration in the Ingress\/Gateway. Then Service A polls an instance of Service B for the traffic requested by Service B. Lastly, the traffic requested by Service A for Service B is polled forward to Service B’s instance.\n\n![Kubernetes](008i3skNly1gsgg6a11l1j31lu0u042s.jpg)\n\n## Kubernetes Multicluster\n\nThe most common usage scenarios for multicluster management include:\n\n- service traffic load balancing\n- isolating development and production environments\n- decoupling data processing and data storage\n- cross-cloud backup and disaster recovery\n- flexible allocation of compute resources\n- low-latency access to services across regions\n- avoiding vendor lock-in\n\nThere are often multiple Kubernetes clusters within an enterprise; and the [KubeFed](https:\/\/github.com\/kubernetes-sigs\/kubefed) implementation of Kubernetes cluster federation developed by [Multicluster SIG](https:\/\/github.com\/kubernetes\/community\/blob\/master\/sig-multicluster\/README.md) enables multicluster management capabilities, which allows all Kubernetes clusters to be managed through the same interface.\n\nThere are several general issues that need to be addressed when using cluster federation:\n\n- Configuring which clusters need to be federated\n- API resources need to be propagated across the clusters\n- Configuring how API resources are distributed to different clusters\n- Registering DNS records in clusters to enable service discovery across clusters\n\nThe following is a multicluster architecture for [KubeSphere](https:\/\/kubesphere.io\/) — one of the most commonly used Kubernetes multicluster management architectures — where the Host Cluster serves as the control plane with two member clusters, West and East.\n\n![Multicluster](008i3skNly1gsgg7a2ojvj31aa0u0491.jpg)\n\nThe Host Cluster needs to be able to access the API Server of the Member Cluster, but the network connectivity between Member Clusters is not required. The Host Cluster is independent of the Member Cluster it manages and the Member Cluster is not aware of the existence of the Host Cluster. The advantage of this is that when the control plane fails, the Member Cluster will not be affected and the deployed load can still operate normally without being affected.\n\nThe Host Cluster also assumes the role of API portal, and the Host Cluster forwards the resource requests to the Member Cluster — which is convenient for aggregation and also facilitates unified authority authentication. We see that there is a Federation Control Plane in the Host Cluster, where the Push Reconciler propagates the identity, role, and role binding from the Federation Cluster to all Member Clusters.\n\n## Istio Service Mesh\n\nConsider using the Istio service mesh when we have multilingual, multiversion microservices running in Kubernetes and need finer-grained canary publishing and unified security policy management for inter-service observability. Istio enables intelligent application-aware load balancing from the application layer to other Service Mesh-enabled services in the cluster, by transparently intercepting all traffic to and from the application using IPTables, and bypassing the primary kube-proxy load balancing. The Istio control plane communicates with the Kubernetes API Server to obtain information about all registered services in the cluster.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the basics of Istio, where all nodes belong to the same Kubernetes cluster.\n\n![Istio Service Mesh](008i3skNly1gsgg6sdrk2j32v60u0qbb.jpg)\n\nYou may end up with at least a few Kubernetes clusters, each hosting microservices. Multiple [deployment models](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/setup\/install\/multicluster\/) exist for Istio’s multicluster deployments — depending on network isolation, primary and backup — which can be specified by declaration when deploying using Istio Operator. Communication between these microservices in a cluster can be enhanced by a service mesh. Within the cluster, Istio provides common communication patterns to improve resiliency, security and observability.\n\nAll of the above is about application load management on Kubernetes, but for legacy applications on virtual machines: how can they be managed in the same plane? Istio supports applications on virtual machines, so why do we need a management plane?\n\n## Management Plane\n\nTo manage gateways, traffic and security groupings, and apply them to different clusters and namespaces, you’ll need to add another layer of abstraction on top of Istio: a management plane. The diagram below shows the multitenant model of Tetrate Service Bridge (TSB). TSB uses Next Generation Access Control (NGAC) — a fine-grained authorization framework — to manage user access and also facilitate the construction of a zero-trust network.\n\n![Management Plane](008i3skNly1gsgg8ndcajj31il0u00z9.jpg)\n\nIstio provides workload identification, protected by strong mTLS encryption. This zero-trust model is better than trusting workloads based on topology information, such as source IP. A common control plane for multicluster management is built on top of Istio. Then a management plane is added to manage multiple clusters — providing multitenancy, management configuration, observability, and more.\n\nThe diagram below shows the architecture of Tetrate Service Bridge.\n\n![Tetrate Service Bridge](008i3skNly1gsgg951mknj314g0u0dnf.jpg)\n\n## Summary\n\nInteroperability of heterogeneous clusters is achieved with Kubernetes. Istio brings containerized and virtual machine loads into a single control plane, to unify traffic, security and observability within the clusters. However, as the number of clusters, network environments and user permissions become more complex, there is a need to build another management plane above Istio’s control plane (for example, [Tetrate Service Bridge](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/tetrate-service-bridge\/)) for hybrid cloud management.\n', '\/en\/blog\/multicluster-management-with-kubernetes-and-istio\/')">

This article will show you how to debug microservices in Kubernetes, introduce common tools, and explain how the introduction of Istio impacts debugging microservices.\n\n## Debugging microservices is vastly different from traditional monolithic applications\n\nThe debugging of microservices has been a long-standing problem for software developers. This challenge does not exist in traditional monolithic applications because developers can leverage the debugger in IDEs to add breakpoints, modify environment variables, single-step execution, etc. for their applications, all of which provide great help in software debugging. With the popularity of Kubernetes, the debugging of microservices becomes a thorny issue, where the following issues are more complicated than the debugging of traditional monolithic applications.\n\n### Multiple dependencies\n\nA microservice often depends on multiple other microservices, some shared volumes across multiple microservices, and authorizations based on service accounts. When debugging a microservice, how do you deploy other dependent services to quickly build a latest set of staging environments?\n\n### Access from a local machine\n\nWhen microservices are running on a developer’s local computer, there is usually no direct access to the services in a Kubernetes cluster. How can you debug microservices deployed in a Kubernetes cluster as if they were local services?\n\n### Slow development loop\n\nUsually, it takes a long process to update the code and build it into an image before pushing it to the cluster. How do you speed up the development cycle? Let’s look at the tools that address those challenges.\n\n## Tools\n\nThe main solutions for debugging microservices in Kubernetes are:\n\n- Proxy: by building a VPN, deploying a proxy in the Kubernetes cluster, and adding local debug endpoints to make the services in Kubernetes directly accessible to local applications, your architecture will look like [ local service ] \u003c-\u003e [ proxy ] \u003c-\u003e [ app in Kubernetes ].\n- Sidecar: Inject a sidecar into the pod of the microservice to be debugged to intercept all traffic to and from the service, so that the service can be tracked and monitored, and the service can also be debugged in this sidecar.\n- Service Mesh: To get an overall picture of the application, inject sidecars into all microservices so that you can get a dashboard that monitors global status.\n\nHere are three typical open source projects that implement the above solutions, each of which can help you debug microservices from a different perspective. You can apply them at different stages of software development and they can be said to be complementary to each other.\n\n### Proxy – debugging microservices with Telepresence\n\n[Telepresence](https:\/\/www.telepresence.io\/) is essentially a local proxy that proxies data volumes, environment variables, and networks in a Kubernetes cluster locally. The following diagram shows the main usage scenarios for Telepresence.\n\n![Proxy mode: Telepresence](telepresence.jpg)\n\nUsers need to manually execute the telepresence command locally, which will automatically deploy the agent to Kubernetes. Once the agent has been deployed,\n\n- Local services will have complete access to other services in the Kubernetes cluster, environment variables, Secret, ConfigMap, etc.\n- Services in the cluster also have direct access to the locally exposed endpoints.\n\nHowever, this approach requires users to run multiple commands while debugging locally, and in some network environments it may not be possible to establish a VPN connection to the Kubernetes cluster.\n\n### Sidecar – debugging microservices with Nocalhost\n\n[Nocalhost](https:\/\/nocalhost.dev\/) is a Kubernetes-based cloud development environment. To use it, you just need to install a plugin in your IDE – VS Code to extend Kubernetes and shorten the development feedback cycle. The development environment can be isolated by creating different namespaces for different users and using ServiceAccount when binding to different user corners. Nocalhost also provides a web console and API for administrators to manage different development environments.\n\n![Sidecar mode: Nocalhost](sidecar-nocalhost.jpg)\n\nAs long as you have a Kubernetes cluster and have admin rights to the cluster, you can refer to the Nocalhost documentation to quickly start trying it out. To use the Nocalhost plugin in VS Code, you need to configure the Kubernetes cluster in the plugin first.\n\n1. Select the Kubeconfig file you just exported or copy and paste the contents of the file directly into the configuration.\n2. Then select the service you need to test and select the corresponding Dev Container. VS Code will automatically open a new code window.\n\nHere is an example of the [bookinfo sample](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/examples\/bookinfo\/) provided by Istio. You can open the cloned code in your local IDE and click the hammer next to the code file to enter development mode. Selecting the corresponding DevContainer and Nocalhost will automatically inject a development container sidecar into the pod and automatically enter the container in the terminal, as shown in the following figure.\n\n![Nocalhost VS code](nocalhost-vs-code.jpg)\n\nIn development mode, the code is modified locally without rebuilding the image, and the remote development environment takes effect in real time, which can greatly accelerate the development speed. At the same time, Nocalhost also provides a server for managing the development environment and user rights, as shown in the following figure.\n\n![Nocalhost Web](nocalhost-web-admin.jpg)\n\n### Service Mesh – debugging microservices with Istio\n\nThe above method of using proxy and sidecar can only debug one service at a time. You’ll need a mesh to get the global status of the application, such as the metrics of the service obtained, and debug the performance of the service by understanding the dependency and invocation process of the service through distributed tracing. These observability features need to be implemented by injecting sidecar uniformly for all services. And, when your services are in the process of migrating from VMs to Kubernetes, using Istio can bring VMs and Kubernetes into a single network plane (as shown below), making it easy for developers to debug and do incremental migrations.\n\n![Service Mesh mode: Istio](istio-service-mesh.jpg)\n\nOf course, these benefits do not come without a “cost.” With the introduction of Istio, your Kubernetes services will need to adhere to the Istio naming convention and you’ll need to know how to debug microservices using the Istioctl command line and logging.\n\n- Use the *istioctl analyze* command to debug the deployment of microservices in your cluster, and you can use YAML files to examine the deployment of resources in a namespace or across your cluster.\n- Use *istioctl proxy-config secret* to ensure that the secret of a pod in a service mesh is loaded correctly and is valid.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn the process of microservicing applications and migrating from virtual machines to Kubernetes, developers need to make a lot of changes in their mindset and habits. By building a VPN between local and Kubernetes via proxy, developers can easily debug services in Kubernetes as if they were local services. By injecting a sidecar into the pod, you can achieve real-time debugging and speed up the development process. Finally, the Istio service mesh truly enables global observability, and you can also use tools like [Tetrate Service Bridge](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/tetrate-service-bridge\/) to manage heterogeneous platforms, helping you gradually move from monolithic applications to microservices.\n', '\/en\/blog\/how-to-debug-microservices-in-kubernetes-with-proxy-sidecar-or-service-mesh\/')">

Rather than introduce you directly to what Istio has to offer, this article will explain how Istio came about and what it is in relation to Kubernetes.\n\n## Why Is There an Istio?\n\nTo explain what Istio is, it’s also important to understand the context in which Istio came into being — i.e., why is there an Istio?\n\nMicroservices are a technical solution to an organizational problem. And Kubernetes\/Istio are a technical solution to deal with the issues created by moving to microservices. As a deliverable for microservices, containers solve the problem of environmental consistency and allow for more granularity in limiting application resources. They are widely used as a vehicle for microservices.\n\nGoogle open-sourced Kubernetes in 2014, which grew exponentially over the next few years. It became a container scheduling tool to solve the deployment and scheduling problems of distributed applications — allowing you to treat many computers as though they were one computer. Because the resources of a single machine are limited and Internet applications may have traffic floods at different times (due to rapid expansion of user scale or different user attributes), the elasticity of computing resources needs to be high. A single machine obviously can’t meet the needs of a large-scale application; and conversely, it would be a huge waste for a very small-scale application to occupy the whole host.\n\nIn short, Kubernetes defines the final state of the service and enables the system to reach and stay in that state automatically. So how do you manage the traffic on the service after the application has been deployed? Below we will look at how service management is done in Kubernetes and how it has changed in Istio.\n\n## How Do You Do Service Management in Kubernetes?\n\nThe following diagram shows the service model in Kubernetes:\n\n![Kubernetes Service Model](service-model.jpg)\n\nFrom the above figure we can see that:\n\n- Different instances of the same service may be scheduled to different nodes.\n- Kubernetes combines multiple instances of a service through Service objects to unify external services.\n- Kubernetes installs a kube-proxy component in each node to forward traffic, which has simple load balancing capabilities.\n- Traffic from outside the Kubernetes cluster can enter the cluster via Ingress (Kubernetes has several other ways of exposing services; such as NodePort, LoadBalancer, etc.).\n\nKubernetes is used as a tool for intensive resource management. However, after allocating resources to the application, Kubernetes doesn’t fully solve the problems of how to ensure the robustness and redundancy of the application, how to achieve finer-grained traffic division (not based on the number of instances of the service), how to guarantee the security of the service, or how to manage multiple clusters, etc.\n\n## The Basics of Istio\n\nThe following diagram shows the service model in Istio, which supports both workloads and virtual machines in Kubernetes.\n\n![Istio](istio.jpg)\n\nFrom the diagram we can see that:\n\n- Istiod acts as the control plane, distributing the configuration to all sidecar proxies and gateways. (Note: for simplification, the connections between Istiod and sidecar are not drawn in the diagram.)\n- Istio enables intelligent application-aware load balancing from the application layer to other mesh enabled services in the cluster, and bypasses the rudimentary kube-proxy load balancing.\n- Application administrators can manipulate the behavior of traffic in the Istio mesh through a declarative API, in the same way they manage workloads in Kubernetes. It can take effects within seconds and they can do this without needing to redeploy.\n- Ingress is replaced by Gateway resources, a special kind of proxy that is also a reused Sidecar proxy.\n- A sidecar proxy can be installed in a virtual machine to bring the virtual machine into the Istio mesh.\n\nIn fact, before Istio one could use SpringCloud, Netflix OSS, and other tools to programmatically manage the traffic in an application, by integrating the SDK in the application. Istio makes traffic management transparent to the application, moving this functionality out of the application and into the platform layer as a cloud native infrastructure.\n\nIstio complements Kubernetes, by enhancing its traffic management, observability and security for cloud native applications. The service mesh open source project — launched in 2017 by Google, IBM and Lyft — has come a long way in three years. A description of Istio’s core features can be found in the [Istio documentation](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/concepts\/what-is-istio\/#core-features).\n\n## Summary\n\n- Service Mesh is the cloud native equivalent of TCP\/IP, addressing application network communication, security and visibility issues.\n- Istio is currently the most popular service mesh implementation, relying on Kubernetes but also scalable to virtual machine loads.\n- Istio’s core consists of a control plane and a data plane, with Envoy as the default data-plane agent.\n- Istio acts as the network layer of the cloud native infrastructure and is transparent to applications.\n', '\/en\/blog\/what-is-istio-and-why-does-kubernetes-need-it\/')">

In addition, I will introduce the load balancing approach in Kubernetes, and explain why you need Istio when you have Kubernetes.', '\nIf you’ve heard of service mesh and tried [Istio](https:\/\/istio.io\/), you may have the following questions:\n\n1. Why is Istio running on Kubernetes?\n2. What is the role of Kubernetes and a service mesh in the cloud native application architecture, respectively?\n3. What aspects of Kubernetes does Istio extend? What problems does it solve?\n4. What is the relationship between Kubernetes, Envoy, and Istio?\n\nThis article will take you through the inner workings of Kubernetes and Istio. In addition, I will introduce the load balancing approach in Kubernetes, and explain why you need Istio when you have Kubernetes.\n\nKubernetes is essentially about application lifecycle management through declarative configuration, while a service mesh is essentially about providing inter-application traffic, security management and observability. If you have already built a stable application platform using Kubernetes, how do you set up load balancing and traffic control for calls between services? This is where a service mesh comes into the picture.\n\nEnvoy introduces the xDS protocol, which is supported by various open source software, such as [Istio](https:\/\/istio.io\/), [MOSN](https:\/\/github.com\/mosn\/mosn), etc. Envoy contributes xDS to a service mesh or cloud native infrastructure. Envoy is essentially a modern version of a proxy that can be configured through APIs, based on which many different usage scenarios are derived — such as API Gateway, sidecar proxy in service mesh, and edge proxy.\n\nThis article contains the following:\n\n- A description of the role of kube-proxy.\n- The limitations of Kubernetes for microservice management.\n- An introduction to the capabilities of Istio service mesh.\n- A comparison of some of the concepts in Kubernetes, Envoy, and the Istio service mesh.\n\n## Kubernetes vs Service Mesh\n\nThe following diagram shows the service access relationship in Kubernetes and service mesh (one sidecar per pod model).\n\n![Kubernetes vs Service Mesh](008eGmZEly1gpb7knfo4dj31hk0redrz.jpg)\n\n### Traffic Forwarding\n\nEach node in a Kubernetes cluster deploys a kube-proxy component that communicates with the Kubernetes API Server, gets information about the services in the cluster, and then sets iptables rules to send requests for service directly to the corresponding Endpoint (a pod belonging to the same group of services).\n\n### Service Discovery\n\n![Service Discovery](008eGmZEly1gpb7knwb79j30kq0fcjs9.jpg)\n\nIstio can follow the service registration in Kubernetes and can also interface with other service discovery systems via platform adapters in the control plane; and then generate data plane configurations (using CRD, which are stored in etcd) with transparent proxies for the data plane. The transparent proxy of the data plane is deployed as a sidecar container in the pod of each application service, and all these proxies need to request the control plane to synchronize the proxy configuration. The proxy is “transparent” because the application container is completely unaware of the presence of the proxy. The kube-proxy component in the process needs to intercept traffic as well, except that the kube-proxy intercepts traffic to and from the Kubernetes node — while the sidecar proxy intercepts traffic to and from the pod.\n\n### Disadvantages of a Service Mesh\n\nSince Kubernetes has many pods running on each node, putting the original kube-proxy route forwarding function in each pod will increase the response latency — due to more hops when the sidecar intercepts the traffic — and consume more resources. In order to manage traffic in a fine-grained manner, a series of new abstractions will be added. This will further increase the learning cost for users, but as the technology becomes more popular this situation will be slowly alleviated.\n\n### Advantages of a Service Mesh\n\nThe kube-proxy settings are global and cannot be controlled at a granular level for each service, while service mesh takes the traffic control out of the service layer in Kubernetes by means of sidecar proxy — allowing for more elasticity.\n\n### Shortcomings of Kube-Proxy\n\nFirst, it does not automatically try another pod if the forwarded pod is not serving properly. Each pod has a health check mechanism and when a pod has health problems, kubelet will restart the pod and kube-proxy will remove the corresponding forwarding rules. Also, nodePort-type services cannot add TLS or more complex message routing mechanisms.\n\nKube-proxy implements load balancing of traffic across multiple pod instances of a Kubernetes service, but how do you do fine-grained control of traffic between these services — such as dividing traffic by percentage to different application versions (which are all part of the same service but on different deployments), or doing canary releases (grayscale releases) and blue-green releases?\n\nThe Kubernetes community gives a way to [do canary releases using Deployment](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/concepts\/cluster-administration\/manage-deployment\/#canary-deployments), which is essentially a way to assign different pods to a deployment’s service by modifying the pod’s label.\n\n## Kubernetes Ingress vs. Istio Gateway\n\nAs mentioned above, kube-proxy can only route traffic within a Kubernetes cluster. The pods of a Kubernetes cluster are located in a network created by CNI. An ingress — a resource object created in Kubernetes — is created for communication outside the cluster. It’s driven by an ingress controller located on Kubernetes edge nodes responsible for managing north-south traffic. Ingress must be docked to various Ingress Controllers, such as the [nginx ingress controller](https:\/\/github.com\/kubernetes\/ingress-nginx) and [traefik](https:\/\/traefik.io\/). Ingress is only applicable to HTTP traffic and is simple to use. It can only route traffic by matching a limited number of fields — such as service, port, HTTP path, etc. This makes it impossible to route TCP traffic such as MySQL, Redis, and various RPCs. This is why you see people writing nginx config language in ingress resource annotations.The only way to directly route north-south traffic is to use the service’s LoadBalancer or NodePort, the former requiring cloud vendor support and the latter requiring additional port management.\n\nIstio Gateway functions similarly to Kubernetes Ingress, in that it is responsible for north-south traffic to and from the cluster. Istio Gateway describes a load balancer for carrying connections to and from the edge of the mesh. The specification describes a set of open ports and the protocols used by those ports, the SNI configuration for load balancing, etc. Gateway is a CRD extension that also reuses the capabilities of the sidecar proxy; see the [Istio website](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/reference\/config\/networking\/gateway\/) for detailed configuration.\n\n## Envoy\n\nEnvoy is the default sidecar proxy in Istio. Istio extends its control plane based on Envoy’s xDS protocol. We need to familiarize ourselves with Envoy’s basic terminology before talking about Envoy’s xDS protocol. The following is a list of basic terms and their data structures in Envoy; please refer to the [Envoy documentation](https:\/\/envoyproxy.io\/) for more details.\n\n![Envoy](008eGmZEly1gpb7koah95j31450tetta.jpg)\n\n### Basic Terminology\n\nThe following are the basic terms in Envoy that you should know.\n\n- **Downstream**: The downstream host connects to Envoy, sends the request, and receives the response; i.e., the host that sent the request.\n- **Upstream**: The upstream host receives connections and requests from Envoy and returns responses; i.e., the host that receives the requests.\n- **Listener**: Listener is a named network address (for example, port, UNIX domain socket, etc.); downstream clients can connect to these listeners. Envoy exposes one or more listeners to the downstream hosts to connect.\n- **Cluster**: A cluster is a group of logically identical upstream hosts to which Envoy connects. Envoy discovers the members of a cluster through service discovery. Optionally, the health status of cluster members can be determined through proactive health checks. Envoy decides which member of the cluster to route requests through a load balancing policy.\n\nMultiple listeners can be set in Envoy, each listener can set a filter chain (filter chain table), and the filter is scalable so that we can more easily manipulate the behavior of traffic — such as setting encryption, private RPC, etc.\n\nThe xDS protocol was proposed by Envoy and is the default sidecar proxy in Istio, but as long as the xDS protocol is implemented, it can theoretically be used as a sidecar proxy in Istio — such as the [MOSN](https:\/\/github.com\/mosn\/mosn) open source by Ant Group.\n\n[008eGmZEly1gpb7kk7wk4j31060lqgqx.jpg)](https:\/\/cdn.thenewstack.io\/media\/2021\/03\/b800bf17-image3.png)\n\nIstio is a very feature-rich service mesh that includes the following capabilities.\n\n- Traffic Management: This is the most basic feature of Istio.\n- Policy Control: Enables access control systems, telemetry capture, quota management, billing, etc.\n- Observability: Implemented in the sidecar proxy.\n- Security Authentication: The Citadel component does key and certificate management.\n\n## Traffic Management in Istio\n\nThe following CRDs are defined in Istio to help users with traffic management.\n\n- Gateway: Gateway describes a load balancer that runs at the edge of the network and is used to receive incoming or outgoing HTTP\/TCP connections.\n- VirtualService: VirtualService actually connects the Kubernetes service to the Istio Gateway. It can also perform additional operations, such as defining a set of traffic routing rules to be applied when a host is addressed.\n- DestinationRule: The policy defined by the DestinationRule determines the access policy for the traffic after it has been routed. Simply put, it defines how traffic is routed. Among others, these policies can be defined as load balancing configurations, connection pool sizes, and external detection (for identifying and expelling unhealthy hosts in the load balancing pool) configurations.\n- EnvoyFilter: The EnvoyFilter object describes filters for proxy services that can customize the proxy configuration generated by Istio Pilot. This configuration is generally rarely used by primary users.\n- ServiceEntry: By default, services in the Istio service mesh are unable to discover services outside of the Mesh. ServiceEntry enables additional entries to be added to the service registry inside Istio, thus allowing automatically discovered services in the mesh to access and route to these manually added services.\n\n## Kubernetes vs. xDS vs. Istio\n\nHaving reviewed the abstraction of traffic management in Kubernetes’ kube-proxy component, xDS, and Istio, let’s look now at a comparison of the three components\/protocols in terms of traffic management only (note that the three are not exactly equivalent).\n\n| **Kubernetes** | **xDS**  | **Istio service mesh** |\n| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------- |\n| Endpoint       | Endpoint | WorkloadEntry          |\n| Service        | Route    | VirtualService         |\n| kube-proxy     | Route    | DestinationRule        |\n| kube-proxy     | Listener | EnvoyFilter            |\n| Ingress        | Listener | Gateway                |\n| Service        | Cluster  | ServiceEntry           |\n\n## Takeaways\n\n- The essence of Kubernetes is application lifecycle management, specifically deployment and management (scaling up and down, auto-recovery, release).\n- Kubernetes provides a scalable and highly resilient deployment and management platform for microservices.\n- A service mesh is based on transparent proxies that intercept traffic between services through sidecar proxies, and then manage the behavior of them through control plane configuration.\n- A service mesh decouples traffic management from Kubernetes, eliminating the need for a kube-proxy component to support traffic within service mesh; and managing inter-service traffic, security and observability by providing an abstraction closer to the microservice application layer.\n- xDS is one of the protocol standards for service mesh configuration.\n- A service mesh is a higher-level abstraction of service in Kubernetes.\n\n## Summary\n\nIf the object managed by Kubernetes is a pod, then the object managed in service mesh is a service, so it’s just a matter of using Kubernetes to manage microservices and then applying service mesh. If you don’t even want to manage a service, then use a serverless platform like [Knative](https:\/\/knative.dev\/) — but that’s an afterthought.\n', '\/en\/blog\/why-do-you-need-istio-when-you-already-have-kubernetes\/')">

It is intended to be used with non-Kubernetes workloads like Virtual Machines and is meant to mimic the existing sidecar injection and deployment specification model used for Kubernetes workloads to bootstrap Istio proxies.', '\n1.8 is the last version of Istio to be released in 2020 and it has the following major updates:\n\n- Supports installation and upgrades using Helm 3.\n- Mixer was officially removed.\n- Added Istio DNS proxy to transparently intercept DNS queries from applications.\n- WorkloadGroup has been added to simplify the integration of virtual machines.\n\nWorkloadGroup is a new API object. It is intended to be used with non-Kubernetes workloads like Virtual Machines and is meant to mimic the existing sidecar injection and deployment specification model used for Kubernetes workloads to bootstrap Istio proxies.\n\n## Installation and Upgrades\n\nIstio starts to officially support the use of [Helm](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/setup\/install\/helm\/) v3 for installations and upgrades. In previous versions, the installation was done with the istioctl command-line tool or Operator. With version 1.8, Istio supports in-place and canary upgrades with Helm.\n\n## Enhancing Istio’s Usability\n\nThe istioctl command-line tool has a new bug reporting feature ([istioctl bug-report](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/reference\/commands\/istioctl\/#istioctl-bug-report)), which can be used to collect debugging information and get cluster status.\n\nThe way to install the [add-on](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2020\/addon-rework\/) has changed: 1.7 istioctl is no longer recommended and has been removed in 1.8, to help solve the problem of add-on lagging upstream and to make it easier to maintain.\n\nTetrate is an enterprise service mesh company. Our flagship product, TSB, enables customers to bridge their workloads across bare metal, VMs, K8s, \u0026 cloud at the application layer and provide a resilient, feature-rich service mesh fabric powered by Istio, Envoy, and Apache SkyWalking.\n\nMixer, the Istio component that had been responsible for policy controls and telemetry collection, has been removed. Its functionalities are now being served by the Envoy proxies. For extensibility, service mesh experts recommend using [WebAssembly](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2020\/wasm-announce\/) (Wasm) to extend Envoy; and you can also try the [GetEnvoy Toolkit](https:\/\/www.getenvoy.io\/reference\/getenvoy_extension_toolkit_reference\/), which makes it easier for developers to create Wasm extensions for Envoy. If you still want to use Mixer, you must use version 1.7 or older. Mixer continued receiving bug fixes and security fixes until Istio 1.7. Many features supported by Mixer have alternatives as specified in the [Mixer Deprecation](https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/mixer-deprecation) document, including the [in-proxy extensions](https:\/\/github.com\/istio\/proxy\/tree\/master\/extensions) based on the Wasm sandbox API.\n\n## Support for Virtual Machines\n\nIstio’s recent upgrades have steadily focused on making virtual machines first-class citizens in the mesh. [Istio 1.7 made progress to support virtual machines](https:\/\/thenewstack.io\/how-to-integrate-virtual-machines-into-istio-service-mesh\/) and Istio 1.8 adds a [smart DNS proxy](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2020\/dns-proxy\/), which is an Istio sidecar agent written in Go. The Istio agent on the sidecar will come with a cache that is dynamically programmed by Istiod DNS Proxy. DNS queries from applications are transparently intercepted and served by an Istio proxy in a pod or VM that intelligently responds to DNS query requests, enabling seamless multicluster access from virtual machines to the service mesh.\n\nIstio 1.8 adds a [WorkloadGroup](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/reference\/config\/networking\/workload-group\/), which describes a collection of workload instances. It provides a specification that the workload instances can use to bootstrap their proxies, including the metadata and identity. It is only intended to be used with non-k8s workloads like Virtual Machines, and is meant to mimic the existing sidecar injection and deployment specification model used for Kubernetes workloads to bootstrap Istio proxies. Using WorkloadGroups, Istio has started to help automate VM registration with [istioctl experimental workload group](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/setup\/install\/virtual-machine\/#create-files-to-transfer-to-the-virtual-machine).\n\n[Tetrate](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/), the enterprise service mesh company, uses these [VM features](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/blog\/whats-new-in-istio-1-8-dns-proxy-helps-expand-mesh-to-vms-and-multicluster\/) extensively in customers’ multicluster deployments, to enable sidecars to resolve DNS for hosts exposed at ingress gateways of all the clusters in a mesh; and to access them over mutual TLS.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAll in all, the Istio team has kept the promise made at the beginning of the year to maintain a regular release cadence of one release every three months since the 1.1 release in 2018, with continuous optimizations in performance and user experience for a seamless experience of brownfield and greenfield apps on Istio. We look forward to more progress from Istio in 2021.', '\/en\/blog\/istio-1-8-a-smart-dns-proxy-takes-support-for-virtual-machines-a-step-further\/')">

This article will show you why Istio needs to integrate with virtual machines and how.', '\n[Istio](https:\/\/istio.io\/) is a popular service mesh to connect, secure, control, and observe services. When it was first introduced as open source in 2017, Kubernetes was winning the container orchestration battle and Istio answered the needs of organizations moving to microservices. Although Istio claims to support heterogeneous environments such as Nomad, Consul, Eureka, Cloud Foundry, Mesos, etc., in reality, it has always worked best with Kubernetes — on which its service discovery is based.\n\nIstio was criticized for a number of issues early in its development, for the large number of components, the complexity of installation and maintenance, the difficulty of debugging, a steep learning curve due to the introduction of too many new concepts and objects (up to 50 CRDs), and the impact of Mixer components on performance. But these issues are gradually being overcome by the Istio team. As you can see from the [roadmap](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/zh\/blog\/2020\/tradewinds-2020\/) released in early 2020, Istio has come a long way.\n\nBetter integration of VM-based workloads into the mesh is a major focus for the Istio team this year. Tetrate also offers seamless multicloud connectivity, security, and observability, including for VMs, via its product [Tetrate Service Bridge](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/tetrate-service-bridge\/). This article will take you through why Istio needs to integrate with virtual machines and how you can do so.\n\n## Why Should Istio Support Virtual Machines?\n\nAlthough containers and Kubernetes are now widely used, there are still many services deployed on virtual machines and APIs outside of the Kubernetes cluster that needs to be managed by Istio mesh. It’s a huge challenge to unify the management of the brownfield environment with the greenfield.\n\n## What Is Needed to Add VMs to the Mesh?\n\nBefore the “how,” I’ll describe *what* is needed to add virtual machines to the mesh. There are a couple of things that Istio must know when supporting virtual machine traffic: which VMs have services that should be part of the mesh, and how to reach the VMs. Each VM also needs an identity, in order to communicate securely with the rest of the mesh. These requirements could work with Kubernetes CRDs, as well as a full-blown Service Registry like Consul. And the service account based identity bootstrapping could work as a mechanism for assigning workload identities to VMs that do not have a platform identity. For VMs that do have a platform identity (like EC2, GCP, Azure, etc.), work is underway in Istio to exchange the platform identity with a Kubernetes identity for ease of setting up mTLS communication.\n\n## How Does Istio Support Virtual Machines?\n\nIstio’s support for virtual machines starts with its service registry mechanism. The information about services and instances in the Istio mesh comes from Istio’s service registries, which up to this point have only looked at or tracked pods. In newer versions, Istio now has resource types to track and watch VMs. The sidecars inside the mesh cannot observe and control traffic to services outside the mesh, because they do not have any information about them.\n\nThe Istio community and [Tetrate](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/) have done a lot of [work](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/blog\/istio-bringing-vms-into-the-mesh-with-cynthia-coan\/) on Istio’s support for virtual machines. The 1.6 release included the addition of WorkloadEntry, which allows you to describe a VM exactly as you would a host running in Kubernetes. In 1.7, the release started to add the foundations for bootstrapping VMs into the mesh automatically through tokens, with Istio doing the heavy lifting. Istio 1.8 will debut another abstraction called WorkloadGroup, which is similar to a Kubernetes Deployment object — but for VMs.\n\nThe following diagram shows how Istio models services in the mesh. The predominant source of information comes from a platform service registry like Kubernetes, or a system like Consul. In addition, the ServiceEntry serves as a user-defined service registry, modeling services on VMs or external services outside the organization.\n\n![](0081Kckwgy1gkp0fvr3orj30p30ehabc.jpg)\n\n**Why install Istio in a virtual machine when you can just use ServiceEntry to bring in the services in the VMs?**\n\nUsing ServiceEntry, you can enable services inside the mesh to discover and access external services; and in addition, manage the traffic to those external services. In conjunction with VirtualService, you can also configure access rules for the corresponding external service — such as request timeouts, fault injection, etc. — to enable controlled access to the specified external service.\n\nEven so, it only controls the traffic on the client-side, not access to the introduced external service to other services. That is, it cannot control the behavior of the service as the call initiator. Deploying sidecars in a virtual machine and introducing the virtual machine workload via workload selector allows the virtual machine to be managed indiscriminately, like a pod in Kubernetes.\n\n## Future\n\nAs you can see from the bookinfo demo, there is too much manual work involved in the process and it’s easy to go wrong. In the future, Istio will improve VM testing to be realistic, automate bootstrapping based on platform identity, improve DNS support and istioctl debugging, and more. You can follow the [Istio Environment Working Group](https:\/\/github.com\/istio\/community\/blob\/master\/WORKING-GROUPS.md) for more details about virtual machine support.\n\n## References\n\n- [Virtual Machine Installation](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/setup\/install\/virtual-machine\/)\n- Virtual Machines in Single-Network Meshes\n- [Istio: Bringing VMs into the Mesh (with Cynthia Coan)](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/blog\/istio-bringing-vms-into-the-mesh-with-cynthia-coan\/)\n- [Bridging Traditional and Modern Workloads](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/blog\/bridging-traditional-and-modern-workloads\/)\n\n', '\/en\/blog\/how-to-integrate-virtual-machines-into-istio-service-mesh\/')">
