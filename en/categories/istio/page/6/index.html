In addition, I will introduce the load balancing approach in Kubernetes, and explain why you need Istio when you have Kubernetes.', '\nIf you’ve heard of service mesh and tried [Istio](https:\/\/istio.io\/), you may have the following questions:\n\n1. Why is Istio running on Kubernetes?\n2. What is the role of Kubernetes and a service mesh in the cloud native application architecture, respectively?\n3. What aspects of Kubernetes does Istio extend? What problems does it solve?\n4. What is the relationship between Kubernetes, Envoy, and Istio?\n\nThis article will take you through the inner workings of Kubernetes and Istio. In addition, I will introduce the load balancing approach in Kubernetes, and explain why you need Istio when you have Kubernetes.\n\nKubernetes is essentially about application lifecycle management through declarative configuration, while a service mesh is essentially about providing inter-application traffic, security management and observability. If you have already built a stable application platform using Kubernetes, how do you set up load balancing and traffic control for calls between services? This is where a service mesh comes into the picture.\n\nEnvoy introduces the xDS protocol, which is supported by various open source software, such as [Istio](https:\/\/istio.io\/), [MOSN](https:\/\/github.com\/mosn\/mosn), etc. Envoy contributes xDS to a service mesh or cloud native infrastructure. Envoy is essentially a modern version of a proxy that can be configured through APIs, based on which many different usage scenarios are derived — such as API Gateway, sidecar proxy in service mesh, and edge proxy.\n\nThis article contains the following:\n\n- A description of the role of kube-proxy.\n- The limitations of Kubernetes for microservice management.\n- An introduction to the capabilities of Istio service mesh.\n- A comparison of some of the concepts in Kubernetes, Envoy, and the Istio service mesh.\n\n## Kubernetes vs Service Mesh\n\nThe following diagram shows the service access relationship in Kubernetes and service mesh (one sidecar per pod model).\n\n![Kubernetes vs Service Mesh](008eGmZEly1gpb7knfo4dj31hk0redrz.jpg)\n\n### Traffic Forwarding\n\nEach node in a Kubernetes cluster deploys a kube-proxy component that communicates with the Kubernetes API Server, gets information about the services in the cluster, and then sets iptables rules to send requests for service directly to the corresponding Endpoint (a pod belonging to the same group of services).\n\n### Service Discovery\n\n![Service Discovery](008eGmZEly1gpb7knwb79j30kq0fcjs9.jpg)\n\nIstio can follow the service registration in Kubernetes and can also interface with other service discovery systems via platform adapters in the control plane; and then generate data plane configurations (using CRD, which are stored in etcd) with transparent proxies for the data plane. The transparent proxy of the data plane is deployed as a sidecar container in the pod of each application service, and all these proxies need to request the control plane to synchronize the proxy configuration. The proxy is “transparent” because the application container is completely unaware of the presence of the proxy. The kube-proxy component in the process needs to intercept traffic as well, except that the kube-proxy intercepts traffic to and from the Kubernetes node — while the sidecar proxy intercepts traffic to and from the pod.\n\n### Disadvantages of a Service Mesh\n\nSince Kubernetes has many pods running on each node, putting the original kube-proxy route forwarding function in each pod will increase the response latency — due to more hops when the sidecar intercepts the traffic — and consume more resources. In order to manage traffic in a fine-grained manner, a series of new abstractions will be added. This will further increase the learning cost for users, but as the technology becomes more popular this situation will be slowly alleviated.\n\n### Advantages of a Service Mesh\n\nThe kube-proxy settings are global and cannot be controlled at a granular level for each service, while service mesh takes the traffic control out of the service layer in Kubernetes by means of sidecar proxy — allowing for more elasticity.\n\n### Shortcomings of Kube-Proxy\n\nFirst, it does not automatically try another pod if the forwarded pod is not serving properly. Each pod has a health check mechanism and when a pod has health problems, kubelet will restart the pod and kube-proxy will remove the corresponding forwarding rules. Also, nodePort-type services cannot add TLS or more complex message routing mechanisms.\n\nKube-proxy implements load balancing of traffic across multiple pod instances of a Kubernetes service, but how do you do fine-grained control of traffic between these services — such as dividing traffic by percentage to different application versions (which are all part of the same service but on different deployments), or doing canary releases (grayscale releases) and blue-green releases?\n\nThe Kubernetes community gives a way to [do canary releases using Deployment](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/concepts\/cluster-administration\/manage-deployment\/#canary-deployments), which is essentially a way to assign different pods to a deployment’s service by modifying the pod’s label.\n\n## Kubernetes Ingress vs. Istio Gateway\n\nAs mentioned above, kube-proxy can only route traffic within a Kubernetes cluster. The pods of a Kubernetes cluster are located in a network created by CNI. An ingress — a resource object created in Kubernetes — is created for communication outside the cluster. It’s driven by an ingress controller located on Kubernetes edge nodes responsible for managing north-south traffic. Ingress must be docked to various Ingress Controllers, such as the [nginx ingress controller](https:\/\/github.com\/kubernetes\/ingress-nginx) and [traefik](https:\/\/traefik.io\/). Ingress is only applicable to HTTP traffic and is simple to use. It can only route traffic by matching a limited number of fields — such as service, port, HTTP path, etc. This makes it impossible to route TCP traffic such as MySQL, Redis, and various RPCs. This is why you see people writing nginx config language in ingress resource annotations.The only way to directly route north-south traffic is to use the service’s LoadBalancer or NodePort, the former requiring cloud vendor support and the latter requiring additional port management.\n\nIstio Gateway functions similarly to Kubernetes Ingress, in that it is responsible for north-south traffic to and from the cluster. Istio Gateway describes a load balancer for carrying connections to and from the edge of the mesh. The specification describes a set of open ports and the protocols used by those ports, the SNI configuration for load balancing, etc. Gateway is a CRD extension that also reuses the capabilities of the sidecar proxy; see the [Istio website](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/reference\/config\/networking\/gateway\/) for detailed configuration.\n\n## Envoy\n\nEnvoy is the default sidecar proxy in Istio. Istio extends its control plane based on Envoy’s xDS protocol. We need to familiarize ourselves with Envoy’s basic terminology before talking about Envoy’s xDS protocol. The following is a list of basic terms and their data structures in Envoy; please refer to the [Envoy documentation](https:\/\/envoyproxy.io\/) for more details.\n\n![Envoy](008eGmZEly1gpb7koah95j31450tetta.jpg)\n\n### Basic Terminology\n\nThe following are the basic terms in Envoy that you should know.\n\n- **Downstream**: The downstream host connects to Envoy, sends the request, and receives the response; i.e., the host that sent the request.\n- **Upstream**: The upstream host receives connections and requests from Envoy and returns responses; i.e., the host that receives the requests.\n- **Listener**: Listener is a named network address (for example, port, UNIX domain socket, etc.); downstream clients can connect to these listeners. Envoy exposes one or more listeners to the downstream hosts to connect.\n- **Cluster**: A cluster is a group of logically identical upstream hosts to which Envoy connects. Envoy discovers the members of a cluster through service discovery. Optionally, the health status of cluster members can be determined through proactive health checks. Envoy decides which member of the cluster to route requests through a load balancing policy.\n\nMultiple listeners can be set in Envoy, each listener can set a filter chain (filter chain table), and the filter is scalable so that we can more easily manipulate the behavior of traffic — such as setting encryption, private RPC, etc.\n\nThe xDS protocol was proposed by Envoy and is the default sidecar proxy in Istio, but as long as the xDS protocol is implemented, it can theoretically be used as a sidecar proxy in Istio — such as the [MOSN](https:\/\/github.com\/mosn\/mosn) open source by Ant Group.\n\n[008eGmZEly1gpb7kk7wk4j31060lqgqx.jpg)](https:\/\/cdn.thenewstack.io\/media\/2021\/03\/b800bf17-image3.png)\n\nIstio is a very feature-rich service mesh that includes the following capabilities.\n\n- Traffic Management: This is the most basic feature of Istio.\n- Policy Control: Enables access control systems, telemetry capture, quota management, billing, etc.\n- Observability: Implemented in the sidecar proxy.\n- Security Authentication: The Citadel component does key and certificate management.\n\n## Traffic Management in Istio\n\nThe following CRDs are defined in Istio to help users with traffic management.\n\n- Gateway: Gateway describes a load balancer that runs at the edge of the network and is used to receive incoming or outgoing HTTP\/TCP connections.\n- VirtualService: VirtualService actually connects the Kubernetes service to the Istio Gateway. It can also perform additional operations, such as defining a set of traffic routing rules to be applied when a host is addressed.\n- DestinationRule: The policy defined by the DestinationRule determines the access policy for the traffic after it has been routed. Simply put, it defines how traffic is routed. Among others, these policies can be defined as load balancing configurations, connection pool sizes, and external detection (for identifying and expelling unhealthy hosts in the load balancing pool) configurations.\n- EnvoyFilter: The EnvoyFilter object describes filters for proxy services that can customize the proxy configuration generated by Istio Pilot. This configuration is generally rarely used by primary users.\n- ServiceEntry: By default, services in the Istio service mesh are unable to discover services outside of the Mesh. ServiceEntry enables additional entries to be added to the service registry inside Istio, thus allowing automatically discovered services in the mesh to access and route to these manually added services.\n\n## Kubernetes vs. xDS vs. Istio\n\nHaving reviewed the abstraction of traffic management in Kubernetes’ kube-proxy component, xDS, and Istio, let’s look now at a comparison of the three components\/protocols in terms of traffic management only (note that the three are not exactly equivalent).\n\n| **Kubernetes** | **xDS**  | **Istio service mesh** |\n| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------- |\n| Endpoint       | Endpoint | WorkloadEntry          |\n| Service        | Route    | VirtualService         |\n| kube-proxy     | Route    | DestinationRule        |\n| kube-proxy     | Listener | EnvoyFilter            |\n| Ingress        | Listener | Gateway                |\n| Service        | Cluster  | ServiceEntry           |\n\n## Takeaways\n\n- The essence of Kubernetes is application lifecycle management, specifically deployment and management (scaling up and down, auto-recovery, release).\n- Kubernetes provides a scalable and highly resilient deployment and management platform for microservices.\n- A service mesh is based on transparent proxies that intercept traffic between services through sidecar proxies, and then manage the behavior of them through control plane configuration.\n- A service mesh decouples traffic management from Kubernetes, eliminating the need for a kube-proxy component to support traffic within service mesh; and managing inter-service traffic, security and observability by providing an abstraction closer to the microservice application layer.\n- xDS is one of the protocol standards for service mesh configuration.\n- A service mesh is a higher-level abstraction of service in Kubernetes.\n\n## Summary\n\nIf the object managed by Kubernetes is a pod, then the object managed in service mesh is a service, so it’s just a matter of using Kubernetes to manage microservices and then applying service mesh. If you don’t even want to manage a service, then use a serverless platform like [Knative](https:\/\/knative.dev\/) — but that’s an afterthought.\n', '\/en\/blog\/why-do-you-need-istio-when-you-already-have-kubernetes\/')">

It is intended to be used with non-Kubernetes workloads like Virtual Machines and is meant to mimic the existing sidecar injection and deployment specification model used for Kubernetes workloads to bootstrap Istio proxies.', '\n1.8 is the last version of Istio to be released in 2020 and it has the following major updates:\n\n- Supports installation and upgrades using Helm 3.\n- Mixer was officially removed.\n- Added Istio DNS proxy to transparently intercept DNS queries from applications.\n- WorkloadGroup has been added to simplify the integration of virtual machines.\n\nWorkloadGroup is a new API object. It is intended to be used with non-Kubernetes workloads like Virtual Machines and is meant to mimic the existing sidecar injection and deployment specification model used for Kubernetes workloads to bootstrap Istio proxies.\n\n## Installation and Upgrades\n\nIstio starts to officially support the use of [Helm](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/setup\/install\/helm\/) v3 for installations and upgrades. In previous versions, the installation was done with the istioctl command-line tool or Operator. With version 1.8, Istio supports in-place and canary upgrades with Helm.\n\n## Enhancing Istio’s Usability\n\nThe istioctl command-line tool has a new bug reporting feature ([istioctl bug-report](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/reference\/commands\/istioctl\/#istioctl-bug-report)), which can be used to collect debugging information and get cluster status.\n\nThe way to install the [add-on](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2020\/addon-rework\/) has changed: 1.7 istioctl is no longer recommended and has been removed in 1.8, to help solve the problem of add-on lagging upstream and to make it easier to maintain.\n\nTetrate is an enterprise service mesh company. Our flagship product, TSB, enables customers to bridge their workloads across bare metal, VMs, K8s, \u0026 cloud at the application layer and provide a resilient, feature-rich service mesh fabric powered by Istio, Envoy, and Apache SkyWalking.\n\nMixer, the Istio component that had been responsible for policy controls and telemetry collection, has been removed. Its functionalities are now being served by the Envoy proxies. For extensibility, service mesh experts recommend using [WebAssembly](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2020\/wasm-announce\/) (Wasm) to extend Envoy; and you can also try the [GetEnvoy Toolkit](https:\/\/www.getenvoy.io\/reference\/getenvoy_extension_toolkit_reference\/), which makes it easier for developers to create Wasm extensions for Envoy. If you still want to use Mixer, you must use version 1.7 or older. Mixer continued receiving bug fixes and security fixes until Istio 1.7. Many features supported by Mixer have alternatives as specified in the [Mixer Deprecation](https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/mixer-deprecation) document, including the [in-proxy extensions](https:\/\/github.com\/istio\/proxy\/tree\/master\/extensions) based on the Wasm sandbox API.\n\n## Support for Virtual Machines\n\nIstio’s recent upgrades have steadily focused on making virtual machines first-class citizens in the mesh. [Istio 1.7 made progress to support virtual machines](https:\/\/thenewstack.io\/how-to-integrate-virtual-machines-into-istio-service-mesh\/) and Istio 1.8 adds a [smart DNS proxy](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2020\/dns-proxy\/), which is an Istio sidecar agent written in Go. The Istio agent on the sidecar will come with a cache that is dynamically programmed by Istiod DNS Proxy. DNS queries from applications are transparently intercepted and served by an Istio proxy in a pod or VM that intelligently responds to DNS query requests, enabling seamless multicluster access from virtual machines to the service mesh.\n\nIstio 1.8 adds a [WorkloadGroup](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/reference\/config\/networking\/workload-group\/), which describes a collection of workload instances. It provides a specification that the workload instances can use to bootstrap their proxies, including the metadata and identity. It is only intended to be used with non-k8s workloads like Virtual Machines, and is meant to mimic the existing sidecar injection and deployment specification model used for Kubernetes workloads to bootstrap Istio proxies. Using WorkloadGroups, Istio has started to help automate VM registration with [istioctl experimental workload group](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/setup\/install\/virtual-machine\/#create-files-to-transfer-to-the-virtual-machine).\n\n[Tetrate](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/), the enterprise service mesh company, uses these [VM features](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/blog\/whats-new-in-istio-1-8-dns-proxy-helps-expand-mesh-to-vms-and-multicluster\/) extensively in customers’ multicluster deployments, to enable sidecars to resolve DNS for hosts exposed at [ingress gateways](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/learn\/kubernetes\/what-is-kubernetes-ingress\/) of all the clusters in a mesh; and to access them over mutual TLS.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAll in all, the Istio team has kept the promise made at the beginning of the year to maintain a regular release cadence of one release every three months since the 1.1 release in 2018, with continuous optimizations in performance and user experience for a seamless experience of brownfield and greenfield apps on Istio. We look forward to more progress from Istio in 2021.', '\/en\/blog\/istio-1-8-a-smart-dns-proxy-takes-support-for-virtual-machines-a-step-further\/')">

This article will show you why Istio needs to integrate with virtual machines and how.', '\n[Istio](https:\/\/istio.io\/) is a popular service mesh to connect, secure, control, and observe services. When it was first introduced as open source in 2017, Kubernetes was winning the container orchestration battle and Istio answered the needs of organizations moving to microservices. Although Istio claims to support heterogeneous environments such as Nomad, Consul, Eureka, Cloud Foundry, Mesos, etc., in reality, it has always worked best with Kubernetes — on which its service discovery is based.\n\nIstio was criticized for a number of issues early in its development, for the large number of components, the complexity of installation and maintenance, the difficulty of debugging, a steep learning curve due to the introduction of too many new concepts and objects (up to 50 CRDs), and the impact of Mixer components on performance. But these issues are gradually being overcome by the Istio team. As you can see from the [roadmap](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/zh\/blog\/2020\/tradewinds-2020\/) released in early 2020, Istio has come a long way.\n\nBetter integration of VM-based workloads into the mesh is a major focus for the Istio team this year. Tetrate also offers seamless multicloud connectivity, security, and observability, including for VMs, via its product [Tetrate Service Bridge](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/tetrate-service-bridge\/). This article will take you through why Istio needs to integrate with virtual machines and how you can do so.\n\n## Why Should Istio Support Virtual Machines?\n\nAlthough containers and Kubernetes are now widely used, there are still many services deployed on virtual machines and APIs outside of the Kubernetes cluster that needs to be managed by Istio mesh. It’s a huge challenge to unify the management of the brownfield environment with the greenfield.\n\n## What Is Needed to Add VMs to the Mesh?\n\nBefore the “how,” I’ll describe *what* is needed to add virtual machines to the mesh. There are a couple of things that Istio must know when supporting virtual machine traffic: which VMs have services that should be part of the mesh, and how to reach the VMs. Each VM also needs an identity, in order to communicate securely with the rest of the mesh. These requirements could work with Kubernetes CRDs, as well as a full-blown Service Registry like Consul. And the service account based identity bootstrapping could work as a mechanism for assigning workload identities to VMs that do not have a platform identity. For VMs that do have a platform identity (like EC2, GCP, Azure, etc.), work is underway in Istio to exchange the platform identity with a Kubernetes identity for ease of setting up mTLS communication.\n\n## How Does Istio Support Virtual Machines?\n\nIstio’s support for virtual machines starts with its service registry mechanism. The information about services and instances in the Istio mesh comes from Istio’s service registries, which up to this point have only looked at or tracked pods. In newer versions, Istio now has resource types to track and watch VMs. The sidecars inside the mesh cannot observe and control traffic to services outside the mesh, because they do not have any information about them.\n\nThe Istio community and [Tetrate](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/) have done a lot of [work](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/blog\/istio-bringing-vms-into-the-mesh-with-cynthia-coan\/) on Istio’s support for virtual machines. The 1.6 release included the addition of WorkloadEntry, which allows you to describe a VM exactly as you would a host running in Kubernetes. In 1.7, the release started to add the foundations for bootstrapping VMs into the mesh automatically through tokens, with Istio doing the heavy lifting. Istio 1.8 will debut another abstraction called WorkloadGroup, which is similar to a Kubernetes Deployment object — but for VMs.\n\nThe following diagram shows how Istio models services in the mesh. The predominant source of information comes from a platform service registry like Kubernetes, or a system like Consul. In addition, the ServiceEntry serves as a user-defined service registry, modeling services on VMs or external services outside the organization.\n\n![](0081Kckwgy1gkp0fvr3orj30p30ehabc.jpg)\n\n**Why install Istio in a virtual machine when you can just use ServiceEntry to bring in the services in the VMs?**\n\nUsing ServiceEntry, you can enable services inside the mesh to discover and access external services; and in addition, manage the traffic to those external services. In conjunction with VirtualService, you can also configure access rules for the corresponding external service — such as request timeouts, fault injection, etc. — to enable controlled access to the specified external service.\n\nEven so, it only controls the traffic on the client-side, not access to the introduced external service to other services. That is, it cannot control the behavior of the service as the call initiator. Deploying sidecars in a virtual machine and introducing the virtual machine workload via workload selector allows the virtual machine to be managed indiscriminately, like a pod in Kubernetes.\n\n## Future\n\nAs you can see from the bookinfo demo, there is too much manual work involved in the process and it’s easy to go wrong. In the future, Istio will improve VM testing to be realistic, automate bootstrapping based on platform identity, improve DNS support and istioctl debugging, and more. You can follow the [Istio Environment Working Group](https:\/\/github.com\/istio\/community\/blob\/master\/WORKING-GROUPS.md) for more details about virtual machine support.\n\n## References\n\n- [Virtual Machine Installation](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/setup\/install\/virtual-machine\/)\n- Virtual Machines in Single-Network Meshes\n- [Istio: Bringing VMs into the Mesh (with Cynthia Coan)](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/blog\/istio-bringing-vms-into-the-mesh-with-cynthia-coan\/)\n- [Bridging Traditional and Modern Workloads](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/blog\/bridging-traditional-and-modern-workloads\/)\n\n', '\/en\/blog\/how-to-integrate-virtual-machines-into-istio-service-mesh\/')">
