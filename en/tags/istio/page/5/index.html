              <a href="#" onclick="exportToMarkdown('Service Mesh - An Integral Part of Cloud-Native Applications', 'This article will explore the relationship between service mesh and cloud native.', '\nIf you don’t know what Istio is, you can read my previous articles below:\n\n- [What Is Istio and Why Does Kubernetes Need it?](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/blog\/what-is-istio-and-why-does-kubernetes-need-it\/)\n- [Why do you need Istio when you already have Kubernetes?](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/blog\/why-do-you-need-istio-when-you-already-have-kubernetes\/)\n\nThis article will explore the relationship between service mesh and cloud native.\n\n### Service mesh – the product of the container orchestration war\n\nIf you’ve been following the cloud-native space since its early days, you’ll remember the container orchestration wars of 2015 to 2017. Kubernetes won the container wars in 2017, the idea of microservices had taken hold, and the trend toward containerization was unstoppable. Kubernetes architecture matured and slowly became boring, and service mesh technologies, represented by Linkerd and Istio, entered the CNCF-defined cloud-native critical technologies on the horizon.\n\nKubernetes was designed with the concept of cloud-native in mind. A critical idea in cloud-native is the architectural design of microservices. When a single application is split into microservices, how can microservices be managed to ensure the SLA of the service as the number of services increases? The service mesh was born to solve this problem at the architectural level, free programmers’ creativity, and avoid tedious service discovery, monitoring, distributed tracing, and other matters.\n\nThe service mesh takes the standard functionality of microservices down to the infrastructure layer, allowing developers to focus more on business logic and thus speed up service delivery, which is consistent with the whole idea of cloud-native. You no longer need to integrate bulky SDKs in your application, develop and maintain SDKs for different languages, and just use the service mesh for Day 2 operations after the application is deployed.\n\nThe service mesh is regarded as the next generation of microservices. In the diagram, we can see that many of the concerns of microservices overlap with the functionality of Kubernetes. Kubernetes focuses on the application lifecycle, managing resources and deployments with little control over services. The service mesh fills this gap. The service mesh can connect, control, observe and protect microservices.\n\n### **Kubernetes vs. xDS vs. Istio**\n\nThis diagram shows the layered architecture of Kubernetes and Istio.\n\n![Kubernetes vs xDS vs Istio](008i3skNly1gxgxss9mamj30n90d73zs.jpg)\n\nThe diagram indicates that the kube-proxy settings are global and cannot be controlled at a granular level for each service. All Kubernetes can do is topology-aware routing, routing traffic closer to the Pod, and setting network policies in and out of the Pod.\n\nIn contrast, the service mesh takes traffic control out of the service layer in Kubernetes through sidecar proxies, injects proxies into each Pod, and manipulates these distributed proxies through a control plane. It allows for more excellent resiliency.\n\nKube-proxy implements traffic load balancing between multiple pod instances of a Kubernetes service. But how do you finely control the traffic between these services — such as dividing the traffic by percentage to different application versions (which are all part of the same service, but on other deployments), or doing canary releases and blue-green releases?\n\nThe Kubernetes community gives a way to do canary releases using Deployment, assigning different pods to deployed services by modifying the pod’s label.\n\n![Envoy Architecture](008i3skNly1gxgxsswmoij30sg0kl76r.jpg)\n\nCurrently, the most popular open-source implementation of service mesh in the world is Istio. From the [CNCF Survey Report 2020](https:\/\/www.cncf.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/CNCF_Survey_Report_2020.pdf), we know that Istio is the most used service mesh in production today. Many companies have built their service mesh based on Istio, such as Ant, Airbnb, eBay, NetEase, Tencent, etc.\n\n![CNCF Survey Report 2020](008i3skNly1gxgxstgg4qj30sg0gg0ts.jpg)\n\nFigure from [CNCF Survey Report 2020](https:\/\/www.cncf.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/CNCF_Survey_Report_2020.pdf)\n\nIstio is developed based on Envoy, which has been used by default as its distributed proxy since the first day it was open-sourced. Envoy pioneered the creation of the xDS protocol for distributed gateway configuration, greatly simplifying the configuration of large-scale distributed networks. Ant Group open source MOSN also supported xDS In 2019. Envoy was also one of the first projects to graduate from CNCF, tested by large-scale production applications.\n\n### Service mesh – the cloud-native networking infrastructure\n\nWith the above comparison between Kubernetes and service mesh in mind, we can see the place of service mesh in the cloud-native application architecture. That is, building a cloud-native network infrastructure specifically provides:\n\n- Traffic management: controlling the flow of traffic and API calls between services, making calls more reliable, and enhancing network robustness in different environments.\n- Observability: understanding the dependencies between services and the nature and flow of traffic between them provides the ability to identify problems quickly.\n- Policy enforcement: controlling access policies between services by configuring the mesh rather than by changing the code.\n- Service Identification and Security: providing service identifiability and security protection in the mesh.\n', '\/en\/blog\/service-mesh-an-integral-part-of-cloud-native-apps\/')">

This article gives you the answer.', '\nAPI gateways have been around for a long time as the entry point for clients to access the back-end, mainly to manage “north-south” traffic, In recent years, service mesh architectures have become popular, mainly for managing internal systems,(i.e. “east-west” traffic), while a service mesh like Istio also has built-in gateways that bring traffic inside and outside the system under unified control. This often creates confusion for first-time users of Istio. What is the relationship between the service mesh and the API gateway? How does Istio’s gateway work? What are the ways to expose the services in the Istio mesh? This article gives you the answer.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n- The service mesh was originally created to solve the problem of managing internal traffic for distributed systems, but API gateways existed long before it.\n- While the Gateway is built into Istio, you can still use a custom Ingress Controller to proxy external traffic.\n- API gateways and service mesh are converging.\n\n## How do I expose services in the Istio mesh?\n\nThe following diagram shows four approaches to expose services in the Istio mesh using Istio Gateway, Kubernetes Ingress, API Gateway, and NodePort\/LB.\n\n![Exposing services through Istio Ingress Gateway](access-cluster.svg)\n\nThe Istio mesh is shaded, and the traffic in the mesh is internal (east-west) traffic, while the traffic from clients accessing services within the Kubernetes cluster is external (north-south) traffic. \n\n| **Approach**          | **Controller**     | **Features**                                                 |\n| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| NodePort\/LoadBalancer | Kubernetes         | Load balancing                                               |\n| Kubernetes Ingress    | Ingress controller | Load balancing, TLS, virtual host, traffic routing           |\n| Istio Gateway         | Istio              | Load balancing, TLS, virtual host, advanced traffic routing, other advanced Istio features |\n| API Gateway           | API Gateway        | Load balancing, TLS, virtual host, advanced traffic routing, API lifecycle management, billing, rate limiting, policy enforcement, data aggregation |\n\nSince NodePort\/LoadBalancer is a basic way to expose services built into Kubernetes, this article will not discuss that option. Each of the other three approaches will be described below.\n\n## Using Kubernetes Ingress to expose traffic\n\nWe all know that clients of a Kubernetes cluster cannot directly access the IP address of a pod because the pod is in a network plane built into Kubernetes. We can expose services inside Kubernetes outside the cluster using NodePort or Load Balancer Kubernetes service type. To support virtual hosting, hiding and saving IP addresses, you can use Ingress resources to expose services in Kubernetes.\n\n![Kubernetes Ingress to expose services](ingress.svg)\n\nIngress is a Kubernetes resource that controls the behavior of an ingress controller that does the traffic touring, which is the equivalent of a load-balanced directional proxy server such as Nginx, Apache, etc., which also includes rule definitions, i.e., routing information for URLs, which is provided by the [Ingress controller](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/concepts\/services-networking\/ingress\/#ingress-controllers).\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io\/v1beta1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io\/ingress.class: istio\n  name: ingress\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - host: httpbin.example.com\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: \/status\/*\n        backend:\n          serviceName: httpbin\n          servicePort: 8000\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThe *kubernetes.io\/ingress.class: istio* annotation in the example above indicates that the Ingress uses the Istio Ingress Controller which in fact uses Envoy proxy. \n\n## Using Istio Gateway to expose services\n\nIstio is a popular service mesh implementation that has evolved from Kubernetes that implements some features that Kubernetes doesn’t. (See [What is Istio and why does Kubernetes need Istio?](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/blog\/what-is-istio-and-why-does-kubernetes-need-it\/)) It makes traffic management transparent to the application, moving this functionality from the application to the platform layer and becoming a cloud-native infrastructure.\n\nIstio used Kubernetes Ingress as the traffic portal in versions prior to Istio 0.8, where Envoy was used as the Ingress Controller. From Istio 0.8 and later, Istio created the Gateway object. Gateway and VirtualService are used to represent the configuration model of Istio Ingress, and the default implementation of Istio Ingress uses the same Envoy proxy. In this way, the Istio control plane controls both the ingress gateway and the internal sidecar proxy with a consistent configuration model. These configurations include routing rules, policy enforcement, telemetry, and other service control functions.\n\nThe Istio Gateway resources function similarly to the Kubernetes Ingress in that it is responsible for north-south traffic to and from the cluster. The Istio Gateway acts as a load balancer to carry connections to and from the edge of the service mesh. The specification describes a set of open ports and the protocols used by those ports, as well as the SNI configuration for load balancing, etc.\n\nThe Istio Gateway resource itself can only be configured for L4 through L6, such as exposed ports, TLS settings, etc.; however, the Gateway can be bound to a VirtualService, where routing rules can be configured on L7, such as versioned traffic routing, fault injection, HTTP redirects, HTTP rewrites, and all other routing rules supported within the mesh.\n\nBelow is an example of a Gateway binding to a VirtualService. The pod with the “istio: ingressgateway” label will act as the Ingress controller and route HTTP traffic to port 80 of the httpbin.example.com virtual host. The biggest difference between this and using Kubernetes Ingress is that it requires us to manually bind the VirtualService to the Gateway and specify the pod where the Gateway is located. This configuration is equivalent to opening up an entry point to Kubernetes for external access.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: networking.istio.io\/v1alpha3\nkind: Gateway\nmetadata:\n  name: httpbin-gateway\nspec:\n  selector:\n    istio: ingressgateway\n  servers:\n  - port:\n      number: 80\n      name: http\n      protocol: HTTP\n    hosts:\n    - \u0022httpbin.example.com\u0022\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThe VirtualService below is bound to the gateway above via *gateways* to accept traffic from that gateway.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: networking.istio.io\/v1alpha3\nkind: VirtualService\nmetadata:\n  name: httpbin\nspec:\n  hosts:\n  - \u0022httpbin.example.com\u0022\n  gateways:\n  - httpbin-gateway\n  http:\n  - match:\n    - uri:\n        prefix: \/status\n    route:\n    - destination:\n        port:\n          number: 8000\n        host: httpbin\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## Using an API Gateway\n\nAPI gateways are API management tools that sit between the client and the back-end service and are widely used in microservices as a way to separate the client interface from the back-end implementation. When a client makes a request, the API gateway breaks it down into multiple requests, then routes them to the correct location, generates a response, and keeps track of everything. \n\nThe API Gateway is a special type of service in the microservices architecture that serves as the entry point for all microservices and is responsible for performing routing requests, protocol conversions, aggregating data, authentication, rate limiting, circuit breaking, and more. Most enterprise APIs are deployed through API Gateways, which typically handle common tasks across API service systems, such as TLS termination, authentication and authorization, rate limiting, and statistical information.\n\nThere can be one or more API Gateways in the mesh. The responsibilities of the API Gateway are\n\n- Request routing and version control\n- Facilitating the transition of monolithic applications to microservices\n- Permission authentication\n- Data aggregation: monitoring and billing\n- Protocol conversion\n- Messaging and caching\n- Security and alerting\n\nMany of the above basic functions such as routing and permission authentication can also be achieved through Istio Gateway, but some mature API gateways may be more advantageous in terms of feature richness and scalability.\n\n- The introduction of API Gateway requires consideration of the deployment, operation and maintenance, load balancing, and other scenarios of API Gateway itself, which increases the complexity of back-end services.\n- An API Gateway carries a large number of interface adaptations, which makes it difficult to maintain.\n- For some scenarios, the addition of a hop may lead to a reduction in performance.\n\nCurrently, some API Gateway imitations are building their own service mesh by deploying them in the sidecar.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn the Istio mesh, you can use a variety of Kubernetes Ingress Controllers to act as entry gateways, but of course, you can also use Istio’s built-in Istio Gateway directly, for policy control, traffic management, and usage monitoring. The advantage of this is that the gateway can be managed directly through Istio’s control plane, without the need for additional tools. But for functions such as API statement cycle management, complex billing, protocol conversion, and authentication, a traditional API gateway may be a better fit for you. So, you can choose according to your needs, or you can use a combination.\n\nSome traditional reverse proxies are also moving towards Service Mesh, such as Nginx with Nginx Service Mesh and Traefik with Traefik Mesh, and some API gateway products are also moving towards Service Mesh, such as Kong with Kuma, and in the future, we will see more convergence of API gateways, reverse proxies, and service meshes.\n', '\/en\/blog\/istio-servicemesh-api-gateway\/')">

              <a href="#" onclick="exportToMarkdown('Multicluster Management With Kubernetes and Istio', 'This article explains three patterns\/tools for debugging microservices in Kubernetes and the changes brought by the introduction of Istio for debugging microservices.', '\nDo you have multiple Kubernetes clusters and a service mesh? Do your virtual machines and services in a Kubernetes cluster need to interact? This article will take you through the process and considerations of building a hybrid cloud using Kubernetes and an Istio Service Mesh. Together, Kubernetes and Istio can be used to bring hybrid workloads into a mesh and achieve interoperability for multicluster. But another layer of infrastructure — a management plane — is helpful for managing multicluster or multimesh deployments.\n\n## Kubernetes\n\nUsing Kubernetes enables rapid deployment of a distributed environment that enables cloud interoperability and unifies the control plane on the cloud. It also provides resource objects, such as Service, Ingress and [Gateway](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/blog\/2021\/04\/22\/evolving-kubernetes-networking-with-the-gateway-api\/), to handle application traffic. The Kubernetes API Server communicates with the kube-proxy component on each node in the cluster, creates iptables rules for the node, and forwards requests to other pods.\n\nAssuming that a client now wants to access a service in Kubernetes, the request is first sent to the Ingress\/Gateway, then forwarded to the backend service (Service A in the diagram below) based on the routing configuration in the Ingress\/Gateway. Then Service A polls an instance of Service B for the traffic requested by Service B. Lastly, the traffic requested by Service A for Service B is polled forward to Service B’s instance.\n\n![Kubernetes](008i3skNly1gsgg6a11l1j31lu0u042s.jpg)\n\n## Kubernetes Multicluster\n\nThe most common usage scenarios for multicluster management include:\n\n- service traffic load balancing\n- isolating development and production environments\n- decoupling data processing and data storage\n- cross-cloud backup and disaster recovery\n- flexible allocation of compute resources\n- low-latency access to services across regions\n- avoiding vendor lock-in\n\nThere are often multiple Kubernetes clusters within an enterprise; and the [KubeFed](https:\/\/github.com\/kubernetes-sigs\/kubefed) implementation of Kubernetes cluster federation developed by [Multicluster SIG](https:\/\/github.com\/kubernetes\/community\/blob\/master\/sig-multicluster\/README.md) enables multicluster management capabilities, which allows all Kubernetes clusters to be managed through the same interface.\n\nThere are several general issues that need to be addressed when using cluster federation:\n\n- Configuring which clusters need to be federated\n- API resources need to be propagated across the clusters\n- Configuring how API resources are distributed to different clusters\n- Registering DNS records in clusters to enable service discovery across clusters\n\nThe following is a multicluster architecture for [KubeSphere](https:\/\/kubesphere.io\/) — one of the most commonly used Kubernetes multicluster management architectures — where the Host Cluster serves as the control plane with two member clusters, West and East.\n\n![Multicluster](008i3skNly1gsgg7a2ojvj31aa0u0491.jpg)\n\nThe Host Cluster needs to be able to access the API Server of the Member Cluster, but the network connectivity between Member Clusters is not required. The Host Cluster is independent of the Member Cluster it manages and the Member Cluster is not aware of the existence of the Host Cluster. The advantage of this is that when the control plane fails, the Member Cluster will not be affected and the deployed load can still operate normally without being affected.\n\nThe Host Cluster also assumes the role of API portal, and the Host Cluster forwards the resource requests to the Member Cluster — which is convenient for aggregation and also facilitates unified authority authentication. We see that there is a Federation Control Plane in the Host Cluster, where the Push Reconciler propagates the identity, role, and role binding from the Federation Cluster to all Member Clusters.\n\n## Istio Service Mesh\n\nConsider using the Istio service mesh when we have multilingual, multiversion microservices running in Kubernetes and need finer-grained canary publishing and unified security policy management for inter-service observability. Istio enables intelligent application-aware load balancing from the application layer to other Service Mesh-enabled services in the cluster, by transparently intercepting all traffic to and from the application using IPTables, and bypassing the primary kube-proxy load balancing. The Istio control plane communicates with the Kubernetes API Server to obtain information about all registered services in the cluster.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the basics of Istio, where all nodes belong to the same Kubernetes cluster.\n\n![Istio Service Mesh](008i3skNly1gsgg6sdrk2j32v60u0qbb.jpg)\n\nYou may end up with at least a few Kubernetes clusters, each hosting microservices. Multiple [deployment models](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/setup\/install\/multicluster\/) exist for Istio’s multicluster deployments — depending on network isolation, primary and backup — which can be specified by declaration when deploying using Istio Operator. Communication between these microservices in a cluster can be enhanced by a service mesh. Within the cluster, Istio provides common communication patterns to improve resiliency, security and observability.\n\nAll of the above is about application load management on Kubernetes, but for legacy applications on virtual machines: how can they be managed in the same plane? Istio supports applications on virtual machines, so why do we need a management plane?\n\n## Management Plane\n\nTo manage gateways, traffic and security groupings, and apply them to different clusters and namespaces, you’ll need to add another layer of abstraction on top of Istio: a management plane. The diagram below shows the multitenant model of Tetrate Service Bridge (TSB). TSB uses Next Generation Access Control (NGAC) — a fine-grained authorization framework — to manage user access and also facilitate the construction of a zero-trust network.\n\n![Management Plane](008i3skNly1gsgg8ndcajj31il0u00z9.jpg)\n\nIstio provides workload identification, protected by strong mTLS encryption. This zero-trust model is better than trusting workloads based on topology information, such as source IP. A common control plane for multicluster management is built on top of Istio. Then a management plane is added to manage multiple clusters — providing multitenancy, management configuration, observability, and more.\n\nThe diagram below shows the architecture of Tetrate Service Bridge.\n\n![Tetrate Service Bridge](008i3skNly1gsgg951mknj314g0u0dnf.jpg)\n\n## Summary\n\nInteroperability of heterogeneous clusters is achieved with Kubernetes. Istio brings containerized and virtual machine loads into a single control plane, to unify traffic, security and observability within the clusters. However, as the number of clusters, network environments and user permissions become more complex, there is a need to build another management plane above Istio’s control plane (for example, [Tetrate Service Bridge](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/tetrate-service-bridge\/)) for hybrid cloud management.\n', '\/en\/blog\/multicluster-management-with-kubernetes-and-istio\/')">

This article will show you how to debug microservices in Kubernetes, introduce common tools, and explain how the introduction of Istio impacts debugging microservices.\n\n## Debugging microservices is vastly different from traditional monolithic applications\n\nThe debugging of microservices has been a long-standing problem for software developers. This challenge does not exist in traditional monolithic applications because developers can leverage the debugger in IDEs to add breakpoints, modify environment variables, single-step execution, etc. for their applications, all of which provide great help in software debugging. With the popularity of Kubernetes, the debugging of microservices becomes a thorny issue, where the following issues are more complicated than the debugging of traditional monolithic applications.\n\n### Multiple dependencies\n\nA microservice often depends on multiple other microservices, some shared volumes across multiple microservices, and authorizations based on service accounts. When debugging a microservice, how do you deploy other dependent services to quickly build a latest set of staging environments?\n\n### Access from a local machine\n\nWhen microservices are running on a developer’s local computer, there is usually no direct access to the services in a Kubernetes cluster. How can you debug microservices deployed in a Kubernetes cluster as if they were local services?\n\n### Slow development loop\n\nUsually, it takes a long process to update the code and build it into an image before pushing it to the cluster. How do you speed up the development cycle? Let’s look at the tools that address those challenges.\n\n## Tools\n\nThe main solutions for debugging microservices in Kubernetes are:\n\n- Proxy: by building a VPN, deploying a proxy in the Kubernetes cluster, and adding local debug endpoints to make the services in Kubernetes directly accessible to local applications, your architecture will look like [ local service ] \u003c-\u003e [ proxy ] \u003c-\u003e [ app in Kubernetes ].\n- Sidecar: Inject a sidecar into the pod of the microservice to be debugged to intercept all traffic to and from the service, so that the service can be tracked and monitored, and the service can also be debugged in this sidecar.\n- Service Mesh: To get an overall picture of the application, inject sidecars into all microservices so that you can get a dashboard that monitors global status.\n\nHere are three typical open source projects that implement the above solutions, each of which can help you debug microservices from a different perspective. You can apply them at different stages of software development and they can be said to be complementary to each other.\n\n### Proxy – debugging microservices with Telepresence\n\n[Telepresence](https:\/\/www.telepresence.io\/) is essentially a local proxy that proxies data volumes, environment variables, and networks in a Kubernetes cluster locally. The following diagram shows the main usage scenarios for Telepresence.\n\n![Proxy mode: Telepresence](telepresence.jpg)\n\nUsers need to manually execute the telepresence command locally, which will automatically deploy the agent to Kubernetes. Once the agent has been deployed,\n\n- Local services will have complete access to other services in the Kubernetes cluster, environment variables, Secret, ConfigMap, etc.\n- Services in the cluster also have direct access to the locally exposed endpoints.\n\nHowever, this approach requires users to run multiple commands while debugging locally, and in some network environments it may not be possible to establish a VPN connection to the Kubernetes cluster.\n\n### Sidecar – debugging microservices with Nocalhost\n\n[Nocalhost](https:\/\/nocalhost.dev\/) is a Kubernetes-based cloud development environment. To use it, you just need to install a plugin in your IDE – VS Code to extend Kubernetes and shorten the development feedback cycle. The development environment can be isolated by creating different namespaces for different users and using ServiceAccount when binding to different user corners. Nocalhost also provides a web console and API for administrators to manage different development environments.\n\n![Sidecar mode: Nocalhost](sidecar-nocalhost.jpg)\n\nAs long as you have a Kubernetes cluster and have admin rights to the cluster, you can refer to the Nocalhost documentation to quickly start trying it out. To use the Nocalhost plugin in VS Code, you need to configure the Kubernetes cluster in the plugin first.\n\n1. Select the Kubeconfig file you just exported or copy and paste the contents of the file directly into the configuration.\n2. Then select the service you need to test and select the corresponding Dev Container. VS Code will automatically open a new code window.\n\nHere is an example of the [bookinfo sample](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/examples\/bookinfo\/) provided by Istio. You can open the cloned code in your local IDE and click the hammer next to the code file to enter development mode. Selecting the corresponding DevContainer and Nocalhost will automatically inject a development container sidecar into the pod and automatically enter the container in the terminal, as shown in the following figure.\n\n![Nocalhost VS code](nocalhost-vs-code.jpg)\n\nIn development mode, the code is modified locally without rebuilding the image, and the remote development environment takes effect in real time, which can greatly accelerate the development speed. At the same time, Nocalhost also provides a server for managing the development environment and user rights, as shown in the following figure.\n\n![Nocalhost Web](nocalhost-web-admin.jpg)\n\n### Service Mesh – debugging microservices with Istio\n\nThe above method of using proxy and sidecar can only debug one service at a time. You’ll need a mesh to get the global status of the application, such as the metrics of the service obtained, and debug the performance of the service by understanding the dependency and invocation process of the service through distributed tracing. These observability features need to be implemented by injecting sidecar uniformly for all services. And, when your services are in the process of migrating from VMs to Kubernetes, using Istio can bring VMs and Kubernetes into a single network plane (as shown below), making it easy for developers to debug and do incremental migrations.\n\n![Service Mesh mode: Istio](istio-service-mesh.jpg)\n\nOf course, these benefits do not come without a “cost.” With the introduction of Istio, your Kubernetes services will need to adhere to the Istio naming convention and you’ll need to know how to debug microservices using the Istioctl command line and logging.\n\n- Use the *istioctl analyze* command to debug the deployment of microservices in your cluster, and you can use YAML files to examine the deployment of resources in a namespace or across your cluster.\n- Use *istioctl proxy-config secret* to ensure that the secret of a pod in a service mesh is loaded correctly and is valid.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn the process of microservicing applications and migrating from virtual machines to Kubernetes, developers need to make a lot of changes in their mindset and habits. By building a VPN between local and Kubernetes via proxy, developers can easily debug services in Kubernetes as if they were local services. By injecting a sidecar into the pod, you can achieve real-time debugging and speed up the development process. Finally, the Istio service mesh truly enables global observability, and you can also use tools like [Tetrate Service Bridge](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/tetrate-service-bridge\/) to manage heterogeneous platforms, helping you gradually move from monolithic applications to microservices.\n', '\/en\/blog\/how-to-debug-microservices-in-kubernetes-with-proxy-sidecar-or-service-mesh\/')">

Today is the fourth anniversary of Istio’s open source arrival. Let’s take a look back at Istio’s four years of development — and look forward to Istio’s future.\n\n### Istio’s open source history\n\nIn 2017, the year Kubernetes ended the container orchestration battle, Google took the opportunity to consolidate its dominance in the cloud native space and compensate for Kubernetes’ disadvantage in service-to-service traffic management by open-sourcing Istio. Istio released its 1.10 last week — but here are some of the most important releases in Istio’s history to date. \n\n| **Date**          | **Version** | **Note**                                                     |\n| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| May 24, 2017      | 0.1         | Officially open source; established the architectural foundation of Control Plane, Data Plane and sidecar proxy. |\n| October 10, 2017  | 0.2         | Started to support multiple runtime environments, such as virtual machines. |\n| June 1, 2018      | 0.8         | API refactoring                                              |\n| July 31, 2018     | 1.0         | Production-ready, after which the Istio team underwent a massive reorganization. |\n| March 19, 2019    | 1.1         | Enterprise-ready. Support for multiple Kubernetes clusters, with performance optimizations. |\n| March 3, 2020     | 1.5         | Back to monolith, with microservice components merged into istiod, making Istio’s architecture cleaner and easier to maintain. Support for WebAssembly extension, making Istio’s ecology much stronger. |\n| November 18, 2020 | 1.8         | Officially deprecated Mixer and focused on adding support for virtual machines. |\n\nA year after its inception– and two months before the 1.0 release, version 0.8 was released with a massive refactoring of the API. In late July 2018, when 1.0 was released, Istio reached a production-ready tipping point. Since then, Google has massively reorganized the Istio team and several Istio-based service mesh startups were born, making 2018 the booming year of the service mesh industry.\n\nIstio 1.1 was released in March 2019, almost 9 months after 1.0 was released, which is far beyond the average release cycle of an open-source project. We know that the speed of iteration and evolution is a core competency of basic software. Since then, Istio has started a regular [release cadence](https:\/\/istio.io\/v1.7\/about\/release-cadence\/) of one version per quarter and has become the [#4 fastest growing project in GitHub’s top 10 in 2019](https:\/\/octoverse.github.com\/#fastest-growing-oss-projects-by-contributors)!\n\n### The Istio community\n\nIn 2020, Istio’s project management began to mature and its governance reached a stage of evolution. We saw the first [election](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2020\/steering-election-results\/) of a steering committee for the Istio community and the transfer of the trademark to [Open Usage Commons](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2020\/open-usage\/). The first [IstioCon](https:\/\/events.istio.io\/istiocon-2021\/) was successfully held in February 2021, with thousands of people attending the online conference. There is also a [large Istio community in China](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6m-rhyfy8sg\u0026list=PL7wB27eZmdffS-g_xh7X-b0echc_XZMKV\u0026index=8), and face-to-face Istio community meetups will be held there in 2021. Stay tuned for more.\n\n![](008i3skNly1gquicfqg14j31lw0smwl2.jpg)\n\nAccording to the CNCF 2020 Survey, 46% of organizations were either using a service mesh in production or planning to use it in the next 12 months. Istio was the top used mesh among those using a mesh in production.\n\n### The future\n\nAfter 4 years of development, there is not only a large user base around Istio, but also several Istio vendors, as you can see on the [homepage](https:\/\/istio.io\/) of the recently revamped Istio website. In the last few releases, Istio has shifted its development focus to improving the Day 2 Operation experience. We also expect to see more Istio adoption path recommendations, case studies, learning materials, training, and certifications (such as the industry’s first [Certified Istio Administrator](https:\/\/academy.tetrate.io\/courses\/certified-istio-administrator) from Tetrate) that will facilitate the adoption of Istio.\n', '\/en\/blog\/istio-4-year-birthday\/')">

Rather than introduce you directly to what Istio has to offer, this article will explain how Istio came about and what it is in relation to Kubernetes.\n\n## Why Is There an Istio?\n\nTo explain what Istio is, it’s also important to understand the context in which Istio came into being — i.e., why is there an Istio?\n\nMicroservices are a technical solution to an organizational problem. And Kubernetes\/Istio are a technical solution to deal with the issues created by moving to microservices. As a deliverable for microservices, containers solve the problem of environmental consistency and allow for more granularity in limiting application resources. They are widely used as a vehicle for microservices.\n\nGoogle open-sourced Kubernetes in 2014, which grew exponentially over the next few years. It became a container scheduling tool to solve the deployment and scheduling problems of distributed applications — allowing you to treat many computers as though they were one computer. Because the resources of a single machine are limited and Internet applications may have traffic floods at different times (due to rapid expansion of user scale or different user attributes), the elasticity of computing resources needs to be high. A single machine obviously can’t meet the needs of a large-scale application; and conversely, it would be a huge waste for a very small-scale application to occupy the whole host.\n\nIn short, Kubernetes defines the final state of the service and enables the system to reach and stay in that state automatically. So how do you manage the traffic on the service after the application has been deployed? Below we will look at how service management is done in Kubernetes and how it has changed in Istio.\n\n## How Do You Do Service Management in Kubernetes?\n\nThe following diagram shows the service model in Kubernetes:\n\n![Kubernetes Service Model](service-model.jpg)\n\nFrom the above figure we can see that:\n\n- Different instances of the same service may be scheduled to different nodes.\n- Kubernetes combines multiple instances of a service through Service objects to unify external services.\n- Kubernetes installs a kube-proxy component in each node to forward traffic, which has simple load balancing capabilities.\n- Traffic from outside the Kubernetes cluster can enter the cluster via Ingress (Kubernetes has several other ways of exposing services; such as NodePort, LoadBalancer, etc.).\n\nKubernetes is used as a tool for intensive resource management. However, after allocating resources to the application, Kubernetes doesn’t fully solve the problems of how to ensure the robustness and redundancy of the application, how to achieve finer-grained traffic division (not based on the number of instances of the service), how to guarantee the security of the service, or how to manage multiple clusters, etc.\n\n## The Basics of Istio\n\nThe following diagram shows the service model in Istio, which supports both workloads and virtual machines in Kubernetes.\n\n![Istio](istio.jpg)\n\nFrom the diagram we can see that:\n\n- Istiod acts as the control plane, distributing the configuration to all sidecar proxies and gateways. (Note: for simplification, the connections between Istiod and sidecar are not drawn in the diagram.)\n- Istio enables intelligent application-aware load balancing from the application layer to other mesh enabled services in the cluster, and bypasses the rudimentary kube-proxy load balancing.\n- Application administrators can manipulate the behavior of traffic in the Istio mesh through a declarative API, in the same way they manage workloads in Kubernetes. It can take effects within seconds and they can do this without needing to redeploy.\n- Ingress is replaced by Gateway resources, a special kind of proxy that is also a reused Sidecar proxy.\n- A sidecar proxy can be installed in a virtual machine to bring the virtual machine into the Istio mesh.\n\nIn fact, before Istio one could use SpringCloud, Netflix OSS, and other tools to programmatically manage the traffic in an application, by integrating the SDK in the application. Istio makes traffic management transparent to the application, moving this functionality out of the application and into the platform layer as a cloud native infrastructure.\n\nIstio complements Kubernetes, by enhancing its traffic management, observability and security for cloud native applications. The service mesh open source project — launched in 2017 by Google, IBM and Lyft — has come a long way in three years. A description of Istio’s core features can be found in the [Istio documentation](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/concepts\/what-is-istio\/#core-features).\n\n## Summary\n\n- Service Mesh is the cloud native equivalent of TCP\/IP, addressing application network communication, security and visibility issues.\n- Istio is currently the most popular service mesh implementation, relying on Kubernetes but also scalable to virtual machine loads.\n- Istio’s core consists of a control plane and a data plane, with Envoy as the default data-plane agent.\n- Istio acts as the network layer of the cloud native infrastructure and is transparent to applications.\n', '\/en\/blog\/what-is-istio-and-why-does-kubernetes-need-it\/')">

In addition, I will introduce the load balancing approach in Kubernetes, and explain why you need Istio when you have Kubernetes.', '\nIf you’ve heard of service mesh and tried [Istio](https:\/\/istio.io\/), you may have the following questions:\n\n1. Why is Istio running on Kubernetes?\n2. What is the role of Kubernetes and a service mesh in the cloud native application architecture, respectively?\n3. What aspects of Kubernetes does Istio extend? What problems does it solve?\n4. What is the relationship between Kubernetes, Envoy, and Istio?\n\nThis article will take you through the inner workings of Kubernetes and Istio. In addition, I will introduce the load balancing approach in Kubernetes, and explain why you need Istio when you have Kubernetes.\n\nKubernetes is essentially about application lifecycle management through declarative configuration, while a service mesh is essentially about providing inter-application traffic, security management and observability. If you have already built a stable application platform using Kubernetes, how do you set up load balancing and traffic control for calls between services? This is where a service mesh comes into the picture.\n\nEnvoy introduces the xDS protocol, which is supported by various open source software, such as [Istio](https:\/\/istio.io\/), [MOSN](https:\/\/github.com\/mosn\/mosn), etc. Envoy contributes xDS to a service mesh or cloud native infrastructure. Envoy is essentially a modern version of a proxy that can be configured through APIs, based on which many different usage scenarios are derived — such as API Gateway, sidecar proxy in service mesh, and edge proxy.\n\nThis article contains the following:\n\n- A description of the role of kube-proxy.\n- The limitations of Kubernetes for microservice management.\n- An introduction to the capabilities of Istio service mesh.\n- A comparison of some of the concepts in Kubernetes, Envoy, and the Istio service mesh.\n\n## Kubernetes vs Service Mesh\n\nThe following diagram shows the service access relationship in Kubernetes and service mesh (one sidecar per pod model).\n\n![Kubernetes vs Service Mesh](008eGmZEly1gpb7knfo4dj31hk0redrz.jpg)\n\n### Traffic Forwarding\n\nEach node in a Kubernetes cluster deploys a kube-proxy component that communicates with the Kubernetes API Server, gets information about the services in the cluster, and then sets iptables rules to send requests for service directly to the corresponding Endpoint (a pod belonging to the same group of services).\n\n### Service Discovery\n\n![Service Discovery](008eGmZEly1gpb7knwb79j30kq0fcjs9.jpg)\n\nIstio can follow the service registration in Kubernetes and can also interface with other service discovery systems via platform adapters in the control plane; and then generate data plane configurations (using CRD, which are stored in etcd) with transparent proxies for the data plane. The transparent proxy of the data plane is deployed as a sidecar container in the pod of each application service, and all these proxies need to request the control plane to synchronize the proxy configuration. The proxy is “transparent” because the application container is completely unaware of the presence of the proxy. The kube-proxy component in the process needs to intercept traffic as well, except that the kube-proxy intercepts traffic to and from the Kubernetes node — while the sidecar proxy intercepts traffic to and from the pod.\n\n### Disadvantages of a Service Mesh\n\nSince Kubernetes has many pods running on each node, putting the original kube-proxy route forwarding function in each pod will increase the response latency — due to more hops when the sidecar intercepts the traffic — and consume more resources. In order to manage traffic in a fine-grained manner, a series of new abstractions will be added. This will further increase the learning cost for users, but as the technology becomes more popular this situation will be slowly alleviated.\n\n### Advantages of a Service Mesh\n\nThe kube-proxy settings are global and cannot be controlled at a granular level for each service, while service mesh takes the traffic control out of the service layer in Kubernetes by means of sidecar proxy — allowing for more elasticity.\n\n### Shortcomings of Kube-Proxy\n\nFirst, it does not automatically try another pod if the forwarded pod is not serving properly. Each pod has a health check mechanism and when a pod has health problems, kubelet will restart the pod and kube-proxy will remove the corresponding forwarding rules. Also, nodePort-type services cannot add TLS or more complex message routing mechanisms.\n\nKube-proxy implements load balancing of traffic across multiple pod instances of a Kubernetes service, but how do you do fine-grained control of traffic between these services — such as dividing traffic by percentage to different application versions (which are all part of the same service but on different deployments), or doing canary releases (grayscale releases) and blue-green releases?\n\nThe Kubernetes community gives a way to [do canary releases using Deployment](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/concepts\/cluster-administration\/manage-deployment\/#canary-deployments), which is essentially a way to assign different pods to a deployment’s service by modifying the pod’s label.\n\n## Kubernetes Ingress vs. Istio Gateway\n\nAs mentioned above, kube-proxy can only route traffic within a Kubernetes cluster. The pods of a Kubernetes cluster are located in a network created by CNI. An ingress — a resource object created in Kubernetes — is created for communication outside the cluster. It’s driven by an ingress controller located on Kubernetes edge nodes responsible for managing north-south traffic. Ingress must be docked to various Ingress Controllers, such as the [nginx ingress controller](https:\/\/github.com\/kubernetes\/ingress-nginx) and [traefik](https:\/\/traefik.io\/). Ingress is only applicable to HTTP traffic and is simple to use. It can only route traffic by matching a limited number of fields — such as service, port, HTTP path, etc. This makes it impossible to route TCP traffic such as MySQL, Redis, and various RPCs. This is why you see people writing nginx config language in ingress resource annotations.The only way to directly route north-south traffic is to use the service’s LoadBalancer or NodePort, the former requiring cloud vendor support and the latter requiring additional port management.\n\nIstio Gateway functions similarly to Kubernetes Ingress, in that it is responsible for north-south traffic to and from the cluster. Istio Gateway describes a load balancer for carrying connections to and from the edge of the mesh. The specification describes a set of open ports and the protocols used by those ports, the SNI configuration for load balancing, etc. Gateway is a CRD extension that also reuses the capabilities of the sidecar proxy; see the [Istio website](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/reference\/config\/networking\/gateway\/) for detailed configuration.\n\n## Envoy\n\nEnvoy is the default sidecar proxy in Istio. Istio extends its control plane based on Envoy’s xDS protocol. We need to familiarize ourselves with Envoy’s basic terminology before talking about Envoy’s xDS protocol. The following is a list of basic terms and their data structures in Envoy; please refer to the [Envoy documentation](https:\/\/envoyproxy.io\/) for more details.\n\n![Envoy](008eGmZEly1gpb7koah95j31450tetta.jpg)\n\n### Basic Terminology\n\nThe following are the basic terms in Envoy that you should know.\n\n- **Downstream**: The downstream host connects to Envoy, sends the request, and receives the response; i.e., the host that sent the request.\n- **Upstream**: The upstream host receives connections and requests from Envoy and returns responses; i.e., the host that receives the requests.\n- **Listener**: Listener is a named network address (for example, port, UNIX domain socket, etc.); downstream clients can connect to these listeners. Envoy exposes one or more listeners to the downstream hosts to connect.\n- **Cluster**: A cluster is a group of logically identical upstream hosts to which Envoy connects. Envoy discovers the members of a cluster through service discovery. Optionally, the health status of cluster members can be determined through proactive health checks. Envoy decides which member of the cluster to route requests through a load balancing policy.\n\nMultiple listeners can be set in Envoy, each listener can set a filter chain (filter chain table), and the filter is scalable so that we can more easily manipulate the behavior of traffic — such as setting encryption, private RPC, etc.\n\nThe xDS protocol was proposed by Envoy and is the default sidecar proxy in Istio, but as long as the xDS protocol is implemented, it can theoretically be used as a sidecar proxy in Istio — such as the [MOSN](https:\/\/github.com\/mosn\/mosn) open source by Ant Group.\n\n[008eGmZEly1gpb7kk7wk4j31060lqgqx.jpg)](https:\/\/cdn.thenewstack.io\/media\/2021\/03\/b800bf17-image3.png)\n\nIstio is a very feature-rich service mesh that includes the following capabilities.\n\n- Traffic Management: This is the most basic feature of Istio.\n- Policy Control: Enables access control systems, telemetry capture, quota management, billing, etc.\n- Observability: Implemented in the sidecar proxy.\n- Security Authentication: The Citadel component does key and certificate management.\n\n## Traffic Management in Istio\n\nThe following CRDs are defined in Istio to help users with traffic management.\n\n- Gateway: Gateway describes a load balancer that runs at the edge of the network and is used to receive incoming or outgoing HTTP\/TCP connections.\n- VirtualService: VirtualService actually connects the Kubernetes service to the Istio Gateway. It can also perform additional operations, such as defining a set of traffic routing rules to be applied when a host is addressed.\n- DestinationRule: The policy defined by the DestinationRule determines the access policy for the traffic after it has been routed. Simply put, it defines how traffic is routed. Among others, these policies can be defined as load balancing configurations, connection pool sizes, and external detection (for identifying and expelling unhealthy hosts in the load balancing pool) configurations.\n- EnvoyFilter: The EnvoyFilter object describes filters for proxy services that can customize the proxy configuration generated by Istio Pilot. This configuration is generally rarely used by primary users.\n- ServiceEntry: By default, services in the Istio service mesh are unable to discover services outside of the Mesh. ServiceEntry enables additional entries to be added to the service registry inside Istio, thus allowing automatically discovered services in the mesh to access and route to these manually added services.\n\n## Kubernetes vs. xDS vs. Istio\n\nHaving reviewed the abstraction of traffic management in Kubernetes’ kube-proxy component, xDS, and Istio, let’s look now at a comparison of the three components\/protocols in terms of traffic management only (note that the three are not exactly equivalent).\n\n| **Kubernetes** | **xDS**  | **Istio service mesh** |\n| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------- |\n| Endpoint       | Endpoint | WorkloadEntry          |\n| Service        | Route    | VirtualService         |\n| kube-proxy     | Route    | DestinationRule        |\n| kube-proxy     | Listener | EnvoyFilter            |\n| Ingress        | Listener | Gateway                |\n| Service        | Cluster  | ServiceEntry           |\n\n## Takeaways\n\n- The essence of Kubernetes is application lifecycle management, specifically deployment and management (scaling up and down, auto-recovery, release).\n- Kubernetes provides a scalable and highly resilient deployment and management platform for microservices.\n- A service mesh is based on transparent proxies that intercept traffic between services through sidecar proxies, and then manage the behavior of them through control plane configuration.\n- A service mesh decouples traffic management from Kubernetes, eliminating the need for a kube-proxy component to support traffic within service mesh; and managing inter-service traffic, security and observability by providing an abstraction closer to the microservice application layer.\n- xDS is one of the protocol standards for service mesh configuration.\n- A service mesh is a higher-level abstraction of service in Kubernetes.\n\n## Summary\n\nIf the object managed by Kubernetes is a pod, then the object managed in service mesh is a service, so it’s just a matter of using Kubernetes to manage microservices and then applying service mesh. If you don’t even want to manage a service, then use a serverless platform like [Knative](https:\/\/knative.dev\/) — but that’s an afterthought.\n', '\/en\/blog\/why-do-you-need-istio-when-you-already-have-kubernetes\/')">

For a detailed analysis of traffic interception, see [Understanding Envoy Sidecar Proxy Injection and Traffic Interception in Istio Service Mesh](\/en\/blog\/envoy-sidecar-injection-in-istio-service-mesh-deep-dive\/).\n\n## Overview of Sidecar Injection and Traffic Interception Steps\n\nBelow is an overview of the steps from Sidecar injection, Pod startup to Sidecar proxy interception traffic and Envoy processing routing.\n\n1. Kubernetes automatically injected through Admission Controller, or the user run \u0060istioctl\u0060 command to manually inject sidecar container.\n2. Apply the YAML configuration deployment application. At this time, the service creation configuration file received by the Kubernetes API server already includes the Init container and the sidecar proxy.\n3. Before the sidecar proxy container and application container are started, the Init container started firstly. The Init container is used to set iptables (the default traffic interception method in Istio, and can also use BPF, IPVS, etc.) to Intercept traffic entering the pod to Envoy sidecar Proxy. All TCP traffic (Envoy currently only supports TCP traffic) will be Intercepted by sidecar, and traffic from other protocols will be requested as originally.\n4. Launch the Envoy sidecar proxy and application container in the Pod.\n\n{{\u003ccallout note\u003e}}\n**Sidecar proxy and application container startup order issues**\n\nStart the sidecar proxy and the application container. Which container is started first? Normally, Envoy Sidecar and the application container are all started up before receiving traffic requests. But we can\u0027t predict which container will start first, so does the container startup order have an impact on Envoy intercepting traffic? The answer is yes, but it is divided into the following two situations.\n\n**Case 1: The application container starts first, and the sidecar proxy is still not ready**\n\nIn this case, the traffic is transferred to the 15001 port by iptables, and the port is not monitored in the Pod. The TCP link cannot be established and the request fails.\n\n**Case 2: Sidecar starts first, the request arrives and the application is still not ready**\n\nIn this case, the request will certainly fail. As for the step at which the failure begins, the reader is left to think.\n\n**Question** : If adding a readiness and living probe for the sidecar proxy and application container can solve the problem?\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\n5. TCP requests that are sent or received from the Pod will be intercepted by iptables. After the inbound traffic is intercepted, it is processed by the Inbound Handler and then forwarded to the application container for processing. The outbound traffic is intercepted by iptables and then forwarded to the Outbound Handler for processing. Upstream and Endpoint.\n6. Sidecar proxy requests Pilot to use the xDS protocol to synchronize Envoy configurations, including LDS, EDS, CDS, etc., but to ensure the order of updates, Envoy will use ADS to request configuration updates from Pilot directly.\n\n## How Envoy handles route forwarding\n\nThe following figure shows a \u0060productpage\u0060service access request \u0060http:\/\/reviews.default.svc.cluster.local:9080\/\u0060, when traffic enters \u0060reviews\u0060 the internal services, \u0060reviews\u0060 internal services Envoy Sidecar is how to do traffic blocked the route forward.\n\n![Istio transparent traffic intercepting and traffic routing schematic](istio-iptables.svg)\n\nBefore the first step, \u0060productpage\u0060 Envoy Sidecar Pod has been selected by EDS of a request to \u0060reviews\u0060 a Pod service of its IP address, it sends a TCP connection request.\n\nThe Envoy configuration in the official website of Istio is to describe the process of Envoy doing traffic forwarding. The party considering the traffic of the downstream is to receive the request sent by the downstream. You need to request additional services, such as \u0060reviews\u0060 service requests need Pod \u0060ratings\u0060 service.\n\n\u0060reviews\u0060, there are three versions of the service, there is one instance of each version, three versions sidecar similar working steps, only to later \u0060reviews-v1-cb8655c75-b97zc\u0060 Sidecar flow Pod forwarding this step will be described.\n\n## Understanding the Inbound Handler\n\nThe role of the inbound handler is to transfer the traffic from the downstream intercepted by iptables to localhost to establish a connection with the application container inside the Pod.\n\nLook \u0060reviews-v1-cb8655c75-b97zc\u0060 at the Listener in the pod.\n\nRun \u0060istioctl pc listener reviews-v1-cb8655c75-b97zc\u0060 to see what the Pod has a Listener.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060ini\nADDRESS            PORT      TYPE \n172.33.3.3         9080      HTTP \u003c---  Receives all inbound traffic on 9080 from listener 0.0.0.0_15006\n10.254.0.1         443       TCP  \u003c--\u002b\n10.254.4.253       80        TCP     |\n10.254.4.253       8080      TCP     |\n10.254.109.182     443       TCP     |\n10.254.22.50       15011     TCP     |\n10.254.22.50       853       TCP     |\n10.254.79.114      443       TCP     | \n10.254.143.179     15011     TCP     |\n10.254.0.2         53        TCP     | Receives outbound non-HTTP traffic for relevant IP:PORT pair from listener 0.0.0.0_15001\n10.254.22.50       443       TCP     |\n10.254.16.64       42422     TCP     |\n10.254.127.202     16686     TCP     |\n10.254.22.50       31400     TCP     |\n10.254.22.50       8060      TCP     |\n10.254.169.13      14267     TCP     |\n10.254.169.13      14268     TCP     |\n10.254.32.134      8443      TCP     |\n10.254.118.196     443       TCP  \u003c--\u002b\n0.0.0.0            15004     HTTP \u003c--\u002b\n0.0.0.0            8080      HTTP    |\n0.0.0.0            15010     HTTP    | \n0.0.0.0            8088      HTTP    |\n0.0.0.0            15031     HTTP    |\n0.0.0.0            9090      HTTP    | \n0.0.0.0            9411      HTTP    |  Receives outbound HTTP traffic for relevant port from listener 0.0.0.0_15001\n0.0.0.0            80        HTTP    |\n0.0.0.0            15030     HTTP    |\n0.0.0.0            9080      HTTP    |\n0.0.0.0            9093      HTTP    |\n0.0.0.0            3000      HTTP    |\n0.0.0.0            8060      HTTP    |\n0.0.0.0            9091      HTTP \u003c--\u002b    \n0.0.0.0            15006     TCP  \u003c--- Receives all inbound and outbound traffic to the pod from IP tables and hands over to virtual listener\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nAs from \u0060productpage\u0060 traffic arriving \u0060reviews\u0060 Pods, downstream must clearly know the IP address of the Pod which is \u0060172.33.3.3\u0060, so the request is \u0060172.33.3.3:9080\u0060.\n\n**Virtual Listener**\n\nAs you can see from the Pod\u0027s Listener list, the 0.0.0.0:15001\/TCP Listener (the actual name is \u0060virtual\u0060) listens for all inbound traffic, and the following is the detailed configuration of the Listener.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060json\n{\n    \u0022name\u0022: \u0022virtual\u0022,\n    \u0022address\u0022: {\n        \u0022socketAddress\u0022: {\n            \u0022address\u0022: \u00220.0.0.0\u0022,\n            \u0022portValue\u0022: 15006\n        }\n    },\n    \u0022filterChains\u0022: [\n        {\n            \u0022filters\u0022: [\n                {\n                    \u0022name\u0022: \u0022envoy.tcp_proxy\u0022,\n                    \u0022config\u0022: {\n                        \u0022cluster\u0022: \u0022BlackHoleCluster\u0022,\n                        \u0022stat_prefix\u0022: \u0022BlackHoleCluster\u0022\n                    }\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ],\n    \u0022useOriginalDst\u0022: true\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**UseOriginalDst** : As can be seen from the configuration in \u0060useOriginalDst\u0060the configuration as specified \u0060true\u0060, which is a Boolean value, the default is false, using iptables redirect connections, the proxy may receive port original destination address is not the same port, thus received at the proxy port It is 15001 and the original destination port is 9080. When this flag is set to true, the Listener redirects the connection to the Listener associated with the original destination address, here \u0060172.33.3.3:9080\u0060. Listener If no relationship to the original destination address, the connection processing by the Listener to receive it, i.e. the \u0060virtual\u0060Listener, after \u0060envoy.tcp_proxy\u0060forwarded to a filter process \u0060BlackHoleCluster\u0060, as the name implies, when no matching Envoy virtual listener when the effect of Cluster , will send the request to it and return 404. This will be referred to below Listener provided \u0060bindToPort\u0060 echoes.\n\n**Note** : This parameter will be discarded, please use the Listener filter of the original destination address instead.

\u0060inbound|9080||reviews.default.svc.cluster.local\u0060 processing.\n\n**Cluster \u0060inbound|9080||reviews.default.svc.cluster.local\u0060**\n\nRun \u0060istioctl pc cluster

directly corresponds to localhost, and then the traffic is forwarded by the application container after iptables.\n\n## Understanding the Outbound Handler\n\nBecause the \u0060reviews\u0060 will to \u0060ratings\u0060 send an HTTP request service, request address are: \u0060http:\/\/ratings.default.svc.cluster.local:9080\/\u0060 the role of Outbound handler is to intercept traffic to iptables to native applications sent via Envoy to determine how to route to the upstream.\n\nThe request sent by the application container is outbound traffic. After being intercepted by iptables, it is transferred to the Envoy Outbound handler for processing, then passed through \u0060virtual\u0060 Listener and \u00600.0.0.0_9080\u0060 Listener, and then finds the cluster of upstream through Route 9080, and then finds Endpoint through EDS to perform routing action. \n\n**Route 9080**\n\n\u0060reviews\u0060 requests \u0060ratings\u0060 service, run \u0060istioctl proxy-config routes reviews-v1-cb8655c75-b97zc --name 9080 -o json\u0060 view route configuration because Envoy VirtualHost will be matched according to HTTP header of domains, so the following list only \u0060ratings.default.svc.cluster.local:9080\u0060 this one VirtualHost.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060json\n[{\n    \u0022name\u0022: \u0022ratings.default.svc.cluster.local:9080\u0022,\n    \u0022domains\u0022: [\n        \u0022ratings.default.svc.cluster.local\u0022,\n        \u0022ratings.default.svc.cluster.local:9080\u0022,\n        \u0022ratings\u0022,\n        \u0022ratings:9080\u0022,\n        \u0022ratings.default.svc.cluster\u0022,\n        \u0022ratings.default.svc.cluster:9080\u0022,\n        \u0022ratings.default.svc\u0022,\n        \u0022ratings.default.svc:9080\u0022,\n        \u0022ratings.default\u0022,\n        \u0022ratings.default:9080\u0022,\n        \u002210.254.234.130\u0022,\n        \u002210.254.234.130:9080\u0022\n    ],\n    \u0022routes\u0022: [\n        {\n            \u0022match\u0022: {\n                \u0022prefix\u0022: \u0022\/\u0022\n            },\n            \u0022route\u0022: {\n                \u0022cluster\u0022: \u0022outbound|9080||ratings.default.svc.cluster.local\u0022,\n                \u0022timeout\u0022: \u00220.000s\u0022,\n                \u0022maxGrpcTimeout\u0022: \u00220.000s\u0022\n            },\n            \u0022decorator\u0022: {\n                \u0022operation\u0022: \u0022ratings.default.svc.cluster.local:9080\/*\u0022\n            },\n            \u0022perFilterConfig\u0022: {...\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n},\n..]\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nYou can see the routing of traffic to the Cluster from this Virtual Host configuration \u0060outbound|9080||ratings.default.svc.cluster.local\u0060.\n\n**Endpoint \u0060outbound|9080||ratings.default.svc.cluster.local\u0060**\n\nIstio 1.1 previous versions do not support the use of \u0060istioctl\u0060 commands to directly query Endpoint Cluster, you can use the debug queries Pilot endpoint way compromise.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl exec reviews-v1-cb8655c75-b97zc -c istio-proxy curl http:\/\/istio-pilot.istio-system.svc.cluster.local:9093\/debug\/edsz \u003e endpoints.json\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n\u0060endpoints.json\u0060 file contains all the Endpoint information of the Cluster, and we only select \u0060outbound|9080||ratings.default.svc.cluster.local\u0060 the results of the Cluster as follows.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060json\n{\n  \u0022clusterName\u0022: \u0022outbound|9080||ratings.default.svc.cluster.local\u0022,\n  \u0022endpoints\u0022: [\n    {\n      \u0022locality\u0022: {\n\n      },\n      \u0022lbEndpoints\u0022: [\n        {\n          \u0022endpoint\u0022: {\n            \u0022address\u0022: {\n              \u0022socketAddress\u0022: {\n                \u0022address\u0022: \u0022172.33.100.2\u0022,\n                \u0022portValue\u0022: 9080\n              }\n            }\n          },\n          \u0022metadata\u0022: {\n            \u0022filterMetadata\u0022: {\n              \u0022istio\u0022: {\n                  \u0022uid\u0022: \u0022kubernetes:\/\/ratings-v1-8558d4458d-ns6lk.default\u0022\n                }\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThe Endpoint can be one or more, and Envoy will route it according to certain rules by selecting the appropriate Endpoint.\n\n**Note** : Istio 1.1 will support the \u0060istioctl pc endpoint\u0060 command to query Endpoint.\n\n## Reference\n\n- [Debugging Envoy and Pilot - istio.io](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/ops\/diagnostic-tools\/proxy-cmd\/)\n- [Understanding Envoy Agent Sidecar Injection and Traffic Interception in Istio Service Mesh - jimmysong.io](\/en\/blog\/envoy-sidecar-injection-in-istio-service-mesh-deep-dive\/)\n- [Istio traffic management implementation mechanism deep analysis - zhaohuabing.com](https:\/\/zhaohuabing.com\/post\/2018-09-25-istio-traffic-management-impl-intro\/)\n\n', '\/en\/blog\/understanding-how-envoy-sidecar-intercept-and-route-traffic-in-istio-service-mesh\/')">
