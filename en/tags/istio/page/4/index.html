It also explains how Istio Ambient Mesh uses Geneve tunnels and the new eBPF mode in Istio 1.18.', '\nIn a previous[ blog post](\/en\/blog\/ambient-mesh-l7-traffic-path\/), I discussed how Istio Ambient Mesh uses iptables and Geneve tunnels to intercept traffic from application pods into Ztunnel. Many readers may not be familiar with this tunneling protocol, so this article will introduce the definition, packet structure and advantages of Geneve tunnels compared with the VXLAN protocol. Finally, this article will introduce how Istio Ambient Mesh applies Geneve tunnels to implement traffic interception and the new eBPF mode introduced in Istio 1.18.\n\n## Introduction to Geneve Tunnels\n\nIn order to address the lack of flexibility and security in current data transmissions, the Geneve (Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation) network virtualization encapsulation (tunneling) protocol was created. Geneve only defines a data encapsulation format, excluding control plane information. The key advantage of Geneve over VXLAN encapsulation is that it extends the types of encapsulated protocols by adding TLV format options.\n\n### Geneve vs. VXLAN\n\nVXLAN and Geneve are both network virtualization protocols and they have many similarities. Virtualization protocols are technologies that separate virtual networks from physical networks. They allow network administrators to create multiple virtual networks in a virtual environment, each of which can have its own VLAN identifiers, IP addresses and routing. In addition, VXLAN and Geneve use UDP encapsulation, which enables them to be extended through existing network infrastructure. VXLAN and Geneve protocols are also flexible, can be used in different network topologies and are compatible with different virtualization platforms.\n\nFigure 1 shows the message structure of VXLAN and Geneve tunnels and the differences in their respective headers.\n\n![Figure 1: VXLAN and Geneve packet format schematic diagram.](vxlan-vs-geneve.svg)\n\nFrom the figure, we can see that the message structure of VXLAN and Geneve tunneling protocols is similar, with the main difference being the use of different UDP port numbers and protocol headers. VXLAN uses port 4789, while Geneve uses port 6081. The Geneve protocol header is more extendable than VXLAN.\n\nThe Geneve tunneling protocol adds variable-length options that can contain zero or more option data in TLV format, making it more scalable than VXLAN. TLV stands for Type-Length-Value, which is a format for parsing and transmitting metadata in network packets. Each metadata information in the Geneve protocol is composed of a TLV format field, making it simple to flexibly add, delete and modify these metadata.\n\nThe TLV format field contains the following data:\n\n- Type: 8-bit type field.\n- Length: 5-bit option length field, represented in multiples of 4 bytes, excluding the option header.\n- Data: Variable-length option data field, which may not exist or may be between 4 and 128 bytes.\n\nThe Geneve protocol can easily modify and extend metadata information while maintaining compatibility and flexibility by using the TLV format.\n\nPlease refer to[ RFC 7348 Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN): A Framework for Overlaying Virtualized Layer 2 Networks over Layer 3 Networks](https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc7348) for more information about VXLAN. For more information about the Geneve tunnel packet format, please refer to[ RFC 8926 Geneve: Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation](https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/rfc\/rfc8926#name-geneve-packet-format-over-i).\n\n### How it Works\n\nThe Geneve tunnel is mainly used in cloud computing and virtualization scenarios, and it can encapsulate packets in a new packet for transmission in a virtual network. The Geneve tunnel uses a 24-bit VNI (Virtual Network Identifier) to transmit packets from one physical network to another. The Geneve tunnel can also use security protocols such as IPsec and TLS to protect the transmission of packets.\n\nWhen a packet reaches the destination host, the Geneve tunnel protocol will de-encapsulate the packet from the Geneve protocol header and deliver it to the destination in the virtual network. During the de-encapsulation process, the VNI information in the Geneve protocol header is used to determine the destination of the packet, ensuring that the packet is correctly routed to the destination in the virtual network.\n\nAssuming there is a virtual network with a VNI of 1001. When a packet is transmitted from one physical network to another, a tunnel can be used to track the packet during transmission by setting the VNI between the source and target physical networks to 1001. When the packet reaches the target physical network, the VNI is removed from the packet and the packet is delivered to the target physical network.\n\n### Security\n\nThe Geneve tunnel protocol itself does not provide any security mechanisms, so packets transmitted in the Geneve tunnel can be subject to threats such as packet tampering, interception and replay.\n\nTo ensure the security of packets transmitted in the Geneve tunnel, some security protocols can be used. The following are some common security protocols:\n\n1. IPsec (Internet Protocol Security): IPsec is a network layer security protocol that can encrypt, authenticate and provide integrity protection to packets in the Geneve tunnel. IPsec can provide end-to-end security.\n2. TLS (Transport Layer Security): TLS is an encryption protocol based on the transport layer that can encrypt and authenticate packets in the Geneve tunnel. TLS can provide end-to-end security.\n3. MACSec (Media Access Control Security): MACSec is a data link layer security protocol that can encrypt and authenticate packets in the Geneve tunnel. MACSec can provide link-layer security.\n\nIt should be noted that the above security protocols require corresponding configuration and deployment and may have a certain impact on performance. When choosing the appropriate security protocol, factors such as security, performance, manageability and other aspects need to be considered.\n\n## Why Choose Geneve?\n\nThe following table compares the characteristics of VXLAN and Geneve in multiple aspects.\n\n| **Feature**   | **VXLAN**                          | **Geneve**                                   |\n| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| Header format | Fixed format                       | Extensible format                            |\n| Scalability   | More focused on L2 extension       | Better support for emerging network services |\n| Operability   | Difficult to manage and extend     | Easier to manage and extend                  |\n| Performance   | Shorter header, higher performance | Longer header, slightly lower performance    |\n\n**Table 1:** *VXLAN vs Geneve characteristics*.\n\nThe main reason for using the Geneve protocol is to combine the advantages of current network virtualization encapsulation technologies (such as VXLAN, NVGRE and STT) into one protocol. Through years of network virtualization development experience, we know that one of the most important requirements is scalability. The Geneve protocol encodes metadata using an extensible TLV structure, so it can independently develop the functionality of software and hardware endpoints to meet growing needs.\n\n## How Istio Ambient Mesh Applies Geneve Tunnels\n\nIn the[ previous blog](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/transparent-traffic-intercepting-and-routing-in-the-l4-network-of-istio-ambient-mesh\/), I explained how Istio Ambient Mesh uses Ztunnel to implement L4 proxies and Figure 2 shows the L4 transparent traffic interception path using iptables and Geneve tunnels.\n\n![Figure 2: L4 Transparent Traffic Interception Path Using Iptables and Geneve Tunnels.](geneve-tunnel.svg)\nFrom the figure, we can see that:\n\n- The Istio CNI creates an \u0060istioout\u0060 network card and iptables rules on the node, transparently intercepting the outbound traffic in the node to the \u0060pistioout\u0060 virtual network card.\n- The Istio CNI creates an \u0060istioin\u0060 network card and iptables rules on the node, transparently intercepting the inbound traffic in the node to the \u0060pistioin\u0060 virtual network card.\n- The Istio CNI creates \u0060pistioin\u0060 and \u0060pistioout\u0060 network cards in ztunnel to receive data packets in the Geneve tunnel.\n\nThe two network cards \u0060pistioin\u0060 and \u0060pistioout\u0060 are created by the init container or Istio CNI (see the \u0060CreateRulesWithinNodeProxyNS\u0060 function in [net_linux.go](https:\/\/github.com\/istio\/istio\/blob\/master\/cni\/pkg\/ambient\/net_linux.go#L910)), and their IP addresses and ports are fixed. The data packets sent by the application container need to pass through the \u0060istioout\u0060 network card and be forwarded to the ztunnel container after being encapsulated in the Geneve tunnel. When the data packets are received by the ztunnel container, they are de-encapsulated and forwarded to the corresponding application containers through the \u0060pistioin\u0060 network card.\n\n## Using eBPF for Transparent Traffic Interception\n\neBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is a powerful technology that allows secure user-space programs to run within the Linux kernel. Initially developed as a technique for filtering network packets, eBPF has now been extended to other areas such as tracking system calls, performance analysis and security monitoring. The advantages of eBPF are its lightweight nature, efficiency, security and programmability. It can be used in real-time monitoring, network security, application debugging and optimization, container networking and various other fields.\n\nIstio Ambient Mesh also supports using the eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) mode for transparent traffic interception since 1.18. As shown in Figure 3, the eBPF program runs directly in the host kernel and forwards application traffic to ztunnel. Compared to the iptables-based approach, the eBPF mode can provide better network efficiency and scalability. However, it requires a higher version of the Linux kernel and is more difficult to implement.\n\n![Figure 3: Intercepting the Traffic of Application Using eBPF.](ebpf.svg)\n\nTo use the eBPF mode to run Ambient Mesh, simply set the \u0060values.cni.ambient.redirectMode\u0060 parameter to “ebpf” when installing Istio, as shown below:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nistioctl install --set profile=ambient --set values.cni.ambient.redirectMode=\u0022ebpf\u0022\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## Summary\n\nThis article introduced the working principle, security and comparison with VXLAN of the Geneve tunnel protocol. In addition, it also introduced how Istio Ambient Mesh uses Geneve tunnels to implement traffic interception and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of using eBPF for transparent traffic interception. The Geneve tunnel protocol is a universal tunneling protocol that can transmit packets in virtual networks, and it has more advantages than other tunneling protocols. Therefore, when choosing a tunneling protocol, users can consider using the Geneve tunnel. In Istio 1.18, the eBPF mode of Ambient Mesh is newly introduced, which can provide better network efficiency, but has higher requirements for the Linux kernel version. Users can choose according to their actual situation.\n\n## References\n\n- [RFC 7348 Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN): A Framework for Overlaying Virtualized Layer 2 Networks over Layer 3 Networks](https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc7348)\n- [RFC 8926 Geneve: Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation](https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/rfc\/rfc8926#name-geneve-packet-format-over-i)\n- [Istio Ambient Mesh](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/ops\/deployment\/architecture\/#istio-ambient-mesh)\n- [Open vSwitch Geneve(8) man page](https:\/\/www.mankier.com\/8\/ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5))\n\n---\n\nIf you’re new to service mesh and Kubernetes security, we have a bunch of free online courses [available at Tetrate Academy](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/academy) that will quickly get you up to speed with Istio and Envoy.\n\nIf you’re looking for a fast way to get to production with Istio, check out [Tetrate Istio Distribution (TID)](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/tid) .

              <a href="#" onclick="exportToMarkdown('How Are Certificates Managed in Istio?', 'This blog post will explain how Istio handles certificate management.', '\nI mentioned in [my last article](\/blog\/understanding-the-tls-encryption-in-istio\/) on understanding mTLS traffic encryption in Istio that the key to traffic encryption is certificate management. We can use the built-in certificate authority (CA) in Istio or a custom CA to manage certificates within the mesh. This blog post will explain how Istio handles certificate management.\n\n## What Is a Certificate?\n\nThere are many types of certificates, but in this article, I am explicitly referring to [X.509 V3](https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/rfc\/rfc5280) certificates. X.509 certificates are a standard digital format used to identify entities in computer networks. X.509 is the international standard for public key infrastructure (PKI) and is primarily used for identity authentication and information encryption, such as TLS.\n\nThe contents of a certificate are hashed using a hash function and then signed with the issuer’s private key. This way, when a certificate is received, the recipient can use the issuer’s public key to verify the certificate’s validity.\n\nA hash function is a function that maps an input of any length (also called a message) to a fixed-length output, also called a *hash value* or *message digest*. There are many hash functions, such as MD5, SHA-1, etc.\n\nA certificate is like a business card issued by an authoritative agency for the user to prove their identity, and it can also be used to encrypt information to ensure the security and integrity of communication. The following diagram shows the general steps of TLS communication, where the certificate proves the server’s identity and encrypts the communication.\n\nFigure 1 shows an example of an HTTP call to a website, issuing a digital certificate, authenticating, and encrypting the communication.\n\n![Figure 1. TLS certificate issuance and validation process](tls.svg)\n\nHere are the detailed steps:\n\n1. The server (website owner) submits a certificate signing request to the CA;\n2. The CA verifies the server’s identity and the authenticity of the website and issues a digital certificate to the server, which the server installs so that visitors can verify the website’s security;\n3. The user sends a request to the website through a browser (client);\n4. The server returns the TLS certificate to the client;\n5. The client verifies the certificate’s validity with the CA and establishes the connection if the certificate is valid, or prompts the user to reject the connection if it is invalid;\n6. The client generates a pair of random public and private keys;\n7. The client sends its public key to the server;\n8. The server encrypts the message using the client’s public key;\n9. The server sends the encrypted data to the client;\n10. The client decrypts the data sent by the server using its private key.\n\nAt this point, both parties have established a secure channel and can transmit encrypted data in both directions.\n\n## How to Generate Certificates\n\nYou can generate X.509 certificates with the following open-source tools:\n\n- [Easy-RSA](https:\/\/github.com\/OpenVPN\/easy-rsa): A simple command-line tool maintained by the OpenVPN project, EasyRSA can easily generate secure certificates and keys for the OpenVPN network.\n- [OpenSSL](https:\/\/github.com\/openssl\/openssl): Originated by an individual in 1995 and now maintained by an independent organization, OpenSSL provides only a command-line tool.\n- [CFSSL](https:\/\/github.com\/cloudflare\/cfssl): Developed and maintained by CloudFlare, CFSSL is not just a command-line tool for generating certificates but also can serve as a PKI server.\n- [BoringSSL](https:\/\/github.com\/google\/boringssl): A branch of OpenSSL developed and maintained by Google, BoringSSL is used in the Chrome browser and Android operating system.\n\nSince most people are probably familiar with OpenSSL, we will use OpenSSL to create certificates in the following text.\n\n## Certificate Trust Chain\n\nThe validation of a certificate requires using a certificate trust chain (Certificate Trust Chain). A certificate trust chain refers to a series of certificates used for identity verification, which form a chain starting from a trusted root certificate issuing agency, connecting downward step by step, until a specific intermediate or terminal certificate is used for verifying a particular certificate. The trustworthiness of a digital certificate increases as the certificate level increases in the certificate trust chain.\n\nIn Figure 2, you can see four trust chains.\n\n![Figure 2. Certificate trust chains](certificate-trust-chain.svg)\n\nCertificate trust chains are tree-like structures, where each CA can have one or more child CAs. There are three roles:\n\n- **Root CA:** The top-level CA can issue certificates to intermediate CAs.\n- **Intermediate CA:** They can issue end-entity certificates.\n- **End entity:** A device or service that holds an end-entity certificate.\n\nRoot CAs are the top-level issuing authorities for digital certificates, so the certificates they issue are the most trustworthy. Root certificate authorities are usually operated and regulated by government agencies or other authoritative organizations such as the International Infrastructure Security Organization. Common root CAs include:\n\n- Symantec\/VeriSign\n- Comodo\n- DigiCert\n- GlobalSign\n- GoDaddy\n- Entrust\n- GeoTrust\n- RapidSSL\n- Baltimore CyberTrust Root\n\nPlease note that the above list is just a sample. There are many other root CAs.\n\nWhen you open an HTTPS webpage in a Chrome browser, you can view the certificate information by clicking on the lock icon on the left side of the address bar, which includes the certificate trust chain, such as the certificate trust chain of [https:\/\/tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/) shown in Figure 3.\n\n![Figure 3. Certificate hierarchy of tetrate.io](tetrate-cert.jpg)\n\nThe certificate trust chain allows the client (such as a web browser) to verify each certificate step by step when verifying the terminal certificate to determine whether it is trustworthy. The principle of digital certificate issuance is that the CA binds the certificate owner’s public key and identity information together. Then the CA uses its proprietary private key to generate a formal digital signature to indicate that the CA issued this certificate. The digital signature on the certificate can be verified using the CA’s public key during certificate verification.\n\n## How to Incorporate Istio into the PKI Certificate Trust Chain\n\nBefore using Istio, enterprises usually have their own internal public key infrastructure . How can Istio be incorporated into the PKI certificate trust chain?\n\nIstio has built-in certificate management functions that can be used out of the box. When Istio is started, it will create a self-signed certificate for *istiod* as the root certificate for all workloads in the mesh. The problem with this is that the built-in root certificate cannot achieve mutual trust between meshes if you have multiple meshes. The correct approach is not to use Istio’s self-signed certificate, but to incorporate Istio into your certificate trust chain and integrate Istio into your PKI, creating an intermediate certificate for each PKI mesh. In this way, two meshes have a shared trust root and can achieve mutual trust between meshes.\n\nIntegrate the Istio mesh into your internal PKI certificate trust chain by creating an intermediate CA, as shown in Figure 4.\n\n![Figure 4: Create intermediate CAs for the multi-cluster mesh to enable Istio to be included in the on-premises PKI certificate trust chain](cluster-ca.svg)\n\nThere are many benefits to incorporating Istio into your company’s internal PKI certificate trust chain:\n\n- **Secure communication across grids\/clusters**: with a common trust root, clusters can verify each other’s identities and communicate with each other;\n- **More granular certificate revocation:** you can revoke the certificate of an individual entity or intermediate CA to revoke the certificate for service or cluster;\n- **Easy implementation of certificate rotation:** you can rotate certificates by cluster\/mesh rather than rotating the root node certificate, which reduces downtime. It is recommended to use [cert-manager](https:\/\/github.com\/cert-manager\/cert-manager) to achieve automated large-scale CA certificate rotation in production. For more information, see [Automate Istio CA Rotation in Production at Scale](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/automate-istio-ca-rotation-in-production-at-scale\/);\n\nFor detailed instructions on incorporating Istio into your company’s internal PKI certificate trust chain, see [this blog post](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/istio-trust\/).\n\n## Steps for Using a Custom CA in Istio\n\nBy default, the Istio CA generates a self-signed root certificate and key and uses them to sign workload certificates. To protect the root CA key, you should use a root CA that runs offline on a secure machine and the root CA to issue intermediate certificates to the Istio CA running on each cluster. The Istio CA can then use the administrator-specified certificate and key to sign workload certificates and distribute the administrator-specified root certificate as the trusted root to workloads.\n\nFigure 5 shows the certificate issuance and mounting process in Istio.\n\n![Figure 5. Certificate issuance and mounting process in Istio](cert-process.svg)\n\n1. In Istio, the Envoy proxy injects two processes into the Pod: *envoy* and *pilot-agent*. The *pilot-agent* generates a private key and uses the Secret Discovery Service (SDS) via a Unix Domain Socket (UDS) to request a certificate signing request (CSR) from the Certificate Authority (CA) through the *istiod*, if you have not configured the CA plugin.\n2. *istiod*, which has a built-in CA, returns the certificate to the *pilot-agent*.\n3. The *pilot-agent* then sends the generated private key and the CA-returned certificate to the Envoy instance to mount.\n\nIstio defaults to using the CA built into *istiod*, but also supports injecting other CAs, see the [Istio documentation](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/tasks\/security\/cert-management\/plugin-ca-cert\/). Suppose you want to create identities for your services using custom CA certificates and keys. In that case, you will need to:\n\n- Create a CA configuration file and use it to create self-signed CA root certificates and keys.\n- Create a private key and signing request configuration files for the service.\n- Create a certificate signing request (CSR) for the service.\n- Use the root certificate and key, along with the service’s signing request file, to create a certificate for the service.\n\nNext, we will detail the process of creating and mounting a certificate for the Bookinfo *productpage* service using Istio’s built-in CA as an example.\n\n## Process for Istio’s Built-in CA to Issue a Certificate\n\nWhen Istio starts, it creates a self-signed CA certificate, which it then uses to issue certificates to services within the mesh. Below, we will manually simulate the steps for Istio’s built-in CA to issue a certificate:\n\n**Step 1:** Create a CA private key **ca.key**:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nopenssl genrsa -out ca.key\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**Step 2:** Create a CA configuration file **ca.conf**:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060ini\n[ req ]\ndefault_bits = 2048\nprompt = no\nutf8 = yes\nencrypt_key = no\ndistinguished_name  = req_dn\nreq_extensions = req_ext\nx509_extensions = req_ext\n\n[ req_dn ]\nO = Istio\nCN = Root CA\n\n[ req_ext ]\nsubjectKeyIdentifier = hash\nbasicConstraints = critical, CA:true\nkeyUsage = critical, digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, keyCertSign\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**Step 3:** Use the CA private key **ca.key** to generate a self-signed certificate **ca.pem**, which contains the CA’s information in the subject:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nopenssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca.key -days 365 -out ca.pem -config ca.conf\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**Step 4:** Create the workload’s private key **workload.key**:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nopenssl genrsa -out workload.key\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**Step 5:** Create a certificate signing request configuration file **csr.conf**, which contains the address of the CA and additional information:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060ini\n[ req ]\ndefault_bits = 2048\nprompt = no\nutf8 = yes\nencrypt_key = no\ndistinguished_name  = dn\nreq_extensions = req_ext\nx509_extensions = req_ext\n\n[ req_dn ]\nO = Istio\nCN = productpage\n\n[ req_ext ]\nsubjectKeyIdentifier = hash\nbasicConstraints = critical, CA:true\nkeyUsage = critical, digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, keyCertSign\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**Step 6:** Create a certificate signing request **workload.csr** based on the workload’s CSR configuration file **csr.conf** and the workload’s private key file **workload.key**:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nopenssl req -new -key workload.key -out workload.csr -config csr.conf\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**Step 7:** Create certificate **workload.pem** based on CA’s private key **ca.key**, CA’s certificate **ca.pem** and workload’s certificate signing request:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nopenssl x509 -req -in workload.csr -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca.key \\\n    -CAcreateserial -out workload.pem -days 365 \\\n    -extensions req_ext -extfile csr.conf -sha256\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**Step 8:** View the certificate chain mounted by the Envoy proxy in the workload:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nistioctl proxy-config secret deployment\/productpage-v1 -o json | jq -r \\\n\u0027.dynamicActiveSecrets[0].secret.tlsCertificate.certificateChain.inlineBytes\u0027 | base64 --decode \u003e chain.pem\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThe **chain.pem** file holds the certificate chain for the *productpage* service. Because we use the Istio built-in CA as the root CA, only one certificate is stored in this file, which can be viewed by running the following command:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nopenssl x509 -noout -text -in chain.pem\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**Step 9:** View the root certificate mounted by the Envoy proxy:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nistioctl proxy-config secret deployment\/productpage-v1 -o json | jq -r \\\n\u0027.dynamicActiveSecrets[1].secret.validationContext.trustedCa.inlineBytes\u0027 | base64 --decode \u003e root.pem\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**root.pem** is the root certificate, run the following command to view:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nopenssl x509 -noout -text -in root.pem\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nAfter the certificate is mounted to the Envoy proxy, *istiod* will take care of periodically replacing the key certificate and revoking the key certificate as needed.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis article introduces you to the function of digital certificates and the trust chain, and how the built-in, out-of-the-box certificate manager operates in Istio. However, the built-in CA in Istio still has certain limitations. In the next blog, I will introduce how to use the SPIRE and cert-manager plugins to achieve fine-grained certificate management and automatic certificate rotation.\n\n---\n\nIf you’re new to service mesh and Kubernetes security, we have a bunch of free online courses [available at Tetrate Academy](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/academy) that will quickly get you up to speed with Istio and Envoy.\n\nIf you’re looking for a fast way to get to production with Istio, check out [Tetrate Istio Distribution (TID)](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/tid).

              <a href="#" onclick="exportToMarkdown('L7 Traffic Path in Ambient Mesh', 'This article describes in detail the L7 traffic path in Ambient Mesh in both diagrammatic and hands-on form.', '\n[In my last blog](\/en\/blog\/ambient-mesh-l4-traffic-path\/), I introduced transparent traffic intercepting and L4 routing in Ambient mode. In this blog, I will show you how L7 traffic is routed.\n\nThe figure below shows the L7 network traffic path in ambient mode.\n\n![Figure 1: L7 network traffic in ambient mesh](ambient-mesh-l7-traffic-path.svg)\n\n\u003e Note: The Waypoint proxy can be located on the same node as the application, and even all of the service and the Waypoint proxy can be on the same node. I draw them on three nodes for display purposes, but it has no significant impact on the actual traffic path, except that it is no longer sent to another node via eth0.\n\nIn the following section, we will explore the process in Figure 1 from a hands-on perspective.\n\n## Environments for Waypoint Proxy\n\nLet’s continue to view the environment description using the ambient mode Istio deployed in the previous blog. To illustrate the L7 network routing, we need to create a Gateway on top of this.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl apply -f - \u003c\u003cEOF\napiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io\/v1alpha2\nkind: Gateway\nmetadata:\n name: productpage\n annotations:\n   istio.io\/service-account: bookinfo-productpage\nspec:\n gatewayClassName: istio-mesh\nEOF\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nAfter executing this command, a Waypoint proxy is created under the default namespace; in my environment, this pod is named \u0060bookinfo-productpage-waypoint-proxy-6f88c55d59-4dzdx\u0060 and is specifically used to handle L7 traffic to the *productpage* service ( Service B), which I will call Waypoint proxy B.\n\nThe Waypoint proxy may be deployed in a different namespace, on a different node from the workload, or both. No matter where the Waypoint proxy is situated, the L7 traffic path is unaffected.\n\nWe will omit the sections of this blog dealing with intercepting inbound and outbound traffic because the way transparent traffic is handled in ambient mesh in L4 and L7 networks is similar. Details are available in the [prior blog](\/en\/blog\/ambient-mesh-l4-traffic-path\/).\n\nWe will start directly with the traffic intercepted at Ztunnel A and then forward it to Envoy port 15006.\n\n## Outbound Traffic Routing on Ztunnel A\n\nUse the following command to dump the Envoy proxy configuration on Ztunnel A:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl exec -n istio-system ztunnel-hptxk -c istio-proxy -- curl \u0022127.0.0.1:15000\/config_dump?include_eds\u0022\u003eztunnel-a-all-include-eds.json\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n10.8.14.226 is the Cluster IP of the target service, and the service port is 9080.

We can also create HPAs to scale it dynamically.\n\n---\n\nIf you’re new to service mesh and Kubernetes security, we have a bunch of free online courses [available at Tetrate Academy](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/academy) that will quickly get you up to speed with Istio and Envoy.\n\nIf you’re looking for a fast way to get to production with Istio, check out [Tetrate Istio Distribution (TID)](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/tid) . TID is Tetrate’s hardened, fully upstream Istio distribution, with FIPS-verified builds and support available. It’s a great way to get started with Istio knowing you have a trusted distribution to begin with, have an expert team supporting you, and also have the option to get to FIPS compliance quickly if you need to.Once you have Istio up and running, you will probably need simpler ways to manage and secure your services beyond what’s available in Istio, that’s where Tetrate Service Bridge comes in. You can learn more about how Tetrate Service Bridge makes service mesh more secure, manageable, and resilient [here](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/tsb) , or [contact us for a quick demo](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/contact) .\n\n*This blog was originally published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/l7-traffic-path-in-ambient-mesh\/).*\n', '\/en\/blog\/ambient-mesh-l7-traffic-path\/')">

Instead of a sidecar proxy in front of every workload, ambient mode uses [*tproxy*](https:\/\/www.kernel.org\/doc\/Documentation\/networking\/tproxy.txt) and [HTTP Based Overlay Network Environment (HBONE)](https:\/\/pkg.go.dev\/github.com\/costinm\/hbone) as key technologies for transparent traffic intercepting and routing that we covered in our recent article on [transparent traffic intercepting and routing in the L4 network of Istio Ambient Mesh](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/transparent-traffic-intercepting-and-routing-in-the-l4-network-of-istio-ambient-mesh\/). In this article, we’ll take a closer look at *tproxy* and how it’s used.\n\n## What Is a Proxy For?\n\nProxies have a wide range of uses on the Internet, such as:\n\n- **Request caching:** to speed up network response, acting similarly to a CDN.\n- **Traffic filtering**: used for network supervision, blocking or allowing access to specific hosts and websites.\n- **Traffic forwarding:** used for load balancing or as a network relay.\n- **Traffic management:** fine-grained management of traffic to and from the proxy, such as publishing to different backends by percentage, timeout and retry settings, circuit breaking, etc.\n- **Security auditing:** logging and limiting client requests for billing or auditing purposes.\n\n## Proxy Types\n\nThere are a number of ways to classify proxies based on how they’re used. You can see two categories based on the location of the proxy in Figure 1:\n\n![Figure 1: Forward proxy and reverse proxy.](proxy.svg)\n\n- **Forward proxies** ([like shadowsocks](https:\/\/shadowsocks.org\/)) run on the client side and send requests to the server on behalf of the client.\n- **Reverse proxies** (often in the form of a web server) accept Internet or external requests on behalf of the server and route them to the corresponding backends.\n\nProxies may be located on the same node as the client or server or on a different node. We can classify them as **transparent** or **non-transparent** based on whether the client or server can see them. Figure 2 (below) shows the process of a client (A) sending a request to a server (C) through a proxy (B).\n\n![Figure 2: Transparent vs. non-transparent proxies](transparent-proxy.svg)\n\n- To use a **non-transparent proxy,** the client needs to explicitly change the destination address to that of the proxy server and use the proxy protocol to connect to the proxy server.\n- To use a **transparent proxy,** the client and the server do not know the proxy is there, which means the client does not need to modify the destination address, and does not need to use the proxy protocol to connect to the proxy server; all the destination address conversion is done in the transparent proxy.\n\n## Using the *tproxy* Transparent Proxy\n\n*tproxy* is a Linux kernel module (since Linux 2.2) that implements transparent proxies. To use *tproxy*, you must first use *iptables* to intercept the required packets at the required NIC, then listen for and forward the packet on that NIC.\n\nFollow these steps to use *tproxy* to implement a transparent proxy:\n\n1. First, you need to implement traffic interception: create a rule in the mangle table of the PREROUTING chain of iptables to intercept traffic and send it to tproxy for processing, for example, \u0060iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp -dport 9080 -j TPROXY --on-port 15001 --on-ip 127.0.0.1 --tproxy-mark 0x1\/0x1\u0060, marking all TCP packets destined for port 9080 with a mark 1. You can specify the source IP address or [IP set](https:\/\/ipset.netfilter.org\/) to further narrow the marking, with *tproxy* listening on port 15001.\n2. Create a routing rule that looks up all packets with mark 1 in a specific routing table: for example, \u0060add ip rule add fwmark 1 lookup 100\u0060, so that all packets with \u0060fwmark 1\u0060 look up to the routing table 100.\n3. Mapping packets to specific local addresses: for example, \u0060ip rule add local 0.0.0.0\/0 dev lo table 100\u0060, which declares all IPv4 addresses as local in the routing table 100, but of course, this is just an example. In practice, you will need to forward packets with specific IPs to the local *lo* loopback NIC.\n\nThe traffic has been intercepted on *tproxy’s* listening port 15001 (enter from Linux kernel space into user space). You can write a web application to process the packets or use *tproxy*-enabled software such as [Squid](http:\/\/www.squid-cache.org\/) or [Envoy](https:\/\/www.envoyproxy.io\/) to process the packets.\n\n## Pros and Cons of Transparent Proxies\n\nTransparent proxies have the following advantages:\n\n- Higher bandwidth and reduced transmission latency, thereby improving the quality of service.\n- No need for users to configure networks and hosts.\n- Control access to network services.\n\nTransparent proxies have the following disadvantages:\n\n- Incorrectly configured, the transparent proxy may prevent connection to the Internet, leaving users unable to troubleshoot and fix errors.\n- Security cannot be guaranteed, as intercepted user traffic may be tampered with by transparent proxies.\n- The risk that transparent proxies may cache user information, leading to privacy leaks.\n\n## Summary\n\nAs a vital type of proxy, transparent proxies are used in a wide range of applications, whether in proxy software such as *shadowsocks*, Xray, or in the Istio service mesh. Understanding how they work helps us use proxies correctly, and whether or not you use a transparent proxy depends on how much you trust and know about it.\n\n---\n\n*This blog was originally published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/what-is-tproxy-and-how-does-it-work\/).*\n', '\/en\/blog\/what-is-tproxy\/')">

How do we determine the service paths and nodes a call goes through to help us troubleshoot the problem? This is where distributed tracing comes into play.\n\nThis article covers:\n\n- How distributed tracing works\n- How to choose distributed tracing software\n- How to use distributed tracing in Istio\n- How to view distributed tracing data using Bookinfo and SkyWalking as examples\n\n## Distributed Tracing Basics\n\nDistributed tracing is a method for tracing requests in a distributed system to help users better understand, control, and optimize distributed systems. There are two concepts used in distributed tracing: TraceID and SpanID. You can see them in Figure 1 below.\n\n- **TraceID** is a globally unique ID that identifies the trace information of a request. All traces of a request belong to the same TraceID, and the TraceID remains constant throughout the trace of the request.\n- **SpanID** is a locally unique ID that identifies a request’s trace information at a certain time. A request generates different SpanIDs at different periods, and SpanIDs are used to distinguish trace information for a request at different periods.\n\nTraceID and SpanID are the basis of distributed tracing. They provide a uniform identifier for request tracing in distributed systems and facilitate users’ ability to query, manage, and analyze the trace information of requests.\n\n![Figure 1: Trace and span](basic.svg)\n\nThe following is the process of distributed tracing:\n\n- When a system receives a request, the distributed tracing system assigns a TraceID to the request, which is used to chain together the entire chain of invocations.\n- The distributed trace system generates a SpanID and ParentID for each service call within the system for the request, which is used to record the parent-child relationship of the call; a Span without a ParentID is used as the entry point of the call chain.\n- TraceID and SpanID are to be passed during each service call.\n- When viewing a distributed trace, query the full process of a particular request by TraceID.\n\n## How Istio Implements Distributed Tracing\n\nIstio’s distributed tracing is based on information collected by the Envoy proxy in the data plane. After a service request is intercepted by Envoy, Envoy adds tracing information as headers to the request forwarded to the destination workload. The following headers are relevant for distributed tracing:\n\n- As TraceID: x-request-id\n- Used to establish parent-child relationships for Span in the LightStep trace: x-ot-span-context\u003c\/li\n- Used for Zipkin, also for Jaeger, SkyWalking, see [b3-propagation](https:\/\/github.com\/openzipkin\/b3-propagation):\n  - *x-b3-traceid*\n  - *x-b3-traceid*\n  - *x-b3-spanid*\n  - *x-b3-parentspanid*\n  - *x-b3-sampled*\n  - *x-b3-flags*\n  - *b3*\n- For Datadog:\n  - *x-datadog-trace-id*\n  - *x-datadog-parent-id*\n  - *x-datadog-sampling-priority*\n- For SkyWalking: *sw8*\n- For AWS X-Ray: *x-amzn-trace-id*\n\nFor more information on how to use these headers, please see the [Envoy documentation](https:\/\/www.envoyproxy.io\/docs\/envoy\/latest\/configuration\/http\/http_conn_man\/headers).\n\nRegardless of the language of your application, Envoy will generate the appropriate tracing headers for you at the Ingress Gateway and forward these headers to the upstream cluster. However, in order to utilize the distributed tracing feature, you must modify your application code to attach the tracing headers to upstream requests. Since neither the service mesh nor the application can automatically propagate these headers, you can integrate the agent for distributed tracing into the application or manually propagate these headers in the application code itself. Once the tracing headers are propagated to all upstream requests, Envoy will send the tracing data to the tracer’s back-end processing, and then you can view the tracing data in the UI.\n\nFor example, look at the code of the Productpage service in the [Bookinfo application](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/examples\/bookinfo\/). You can see that it integrates the Jaeger client library and synchronizes the header generated by Envoy with the HTTP requests to the Details and Reviews services in the *getForwardHeaders (request)* function.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060python\ndef getForwardHeaders(request):\n    headers = {}\n\n    # Using Jaeger agent to get the x-b3-* headers\n    span = get_current_span()\n    carrier = {}\n    tracer.inject(\n        span_context=span.context,\n        format=Format.HTTP_HEADERS,\n        carrier=carrier)\n\n    headers.update(carrier)\n\n    # Dealing with the non x-b3-* header manually\n    if \u0027user\u0027 in session:\n        headers[\u0027end-user\u0027] = session[\u0027user\u0027]\n    incoming_headers = [\n        \u0027x-request-id\u0027,\n        \u0027x-ot-span-context\u0027,\n        \u0027x-datadog-trace-id\u0027,\n        \u0027x-datadog-parent-id\u0027,\n        \u0027x-datadog-sampling-priority\u0027,\n        \u0027traceparent\u0027,\n        \u0027tracestate\u0027,\n        \u0027x-cloud-trace-context\u0027,\n        \u0027grpc-trace-bin\u0027,\n        \u0027sw8\u0027,\n        \u0027user-agent\u0027,\n        \u0027cookie\u0027,\n        \u0027authorization\u0027,\n        \u0027jwt\u0027,\n    ]\n\n    for ihdr in incoming_headers:\n        val = request.headers.get(ihdr)\n        if val is not None:\n            headers[ihdr] = val\n\n    return headers\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nFor more information, the [Istio documentation](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/about\/faq\/#distributed-tracing) provides answers to frequently asked questions about distributed tracing in Istio.\n\n## How to Choose A Distributed Tracing System\n\nDistributed tracing systems are similar in principle. There are many such systems on the market, such as [Apache SkyWalking](https:\/\/github.com\/apache\/skywalking), [Jaeger](https:\/\/github.com\/jaegertracing\/jaeger), [Zipkin](https:\/\/github.com\/openzipkin\/zipkin\/), Lightstep, [Pinpoint](https:\/\/github.com\/pinpoint-apm\/pinpoint), and so on. For our purposes here, we will choose three of them and compare them in several dimensions. Here are our inclusion criteria:\n\n- They are currently the most popular open-source distributed tracing systems.\n- All are based on the OpenTracing specification.\n- They support integration with Istio and Envoy.\n\n| Items               | Apache SkyWalking                                            | Jaeger                                       | Zipkin                                       |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| Implementations     | Language-based probes, service mesh probes, eBPF agent, third-party instrumental libraries (Zipkin currently supported) | Language-based probes                        | Language-based probes                        |\n| Database            | ES, H2, MySQL, TiDB, Sharding-sphere, BanyanDB               | ES, MySQL, Cassandra, Memory                 | ES, MySQL, Cassandra, Memory                 |\n| Supported Languages | Java, Rust, PHP, NodeJS, Go, Python, C\u002b\u002b, .Net, Lua          | Java, Go, Python, NodeJS, C#, PHP, Ruby, C\u002b\u002b | Java, Go, Python, NodeJS, C#, PHP, Ruby, C\u002b\u002b |\n| Initiator           | Personal                                                     | Uber                                         | Twitter                                      |\n| Governance          | Apache Foundation                                            | CNCF                                         | CNCF                                         |\n| Version             | 9.3.0                                                        | 1.39.0                                       | 2.23.19                                      |\n| Stars               | 20.9k                                                        | 16.8k                                        | 15.8k                                        |\n\nAlthough Apache SkyWalking’s agent does not support as many languages as Jaeger and Zipkin, SkyWalking’s implementation is richer and compatible with Jaeger and Zipkin trace data, and development is more active, so it is one of the best choices for building a telemetry platform.\n\n## Demo\n\nRefer to the [Istio documentation](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/tasks\/observability\/distributed-tracing\/skywalking\/) to install and configure Apache SkyWalking.\n\n### Environment Description\n\nThe following is the environment for our demo:\n\n- Kubernetes 1.24.5\n- Istio 1.16\n- SkyWalking 9.1.0\n\n### Install Istio\n\nBefore installing Istio, you can check the environment for any problems:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\n$ istioctl experimental precheck\n✔ No issues found when checking the cluster. Istio is safe to install or upgrade!\n  To get started, check out https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/setup\/getting-started\/\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThen install Istio and configure the destination for sending tracing messages as SkyWalking:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\n# Initial Istio Operator\nistioctl operator init\n# Configure tracing destination\nkubectl apply -f - \u003c\u003cEOF\napiVersion: install.istio.io\/v1alpha1\nkind: IstioOperator\nmetadata:\n  namespace: istio-system\n  name: istio-with-skywalking\nspec:\n  meshConfig:\n    defaultProviders:\n      tracing:\n      - \u0022skywalking\u0022\n    enableTracing: true\n    extensionProviders:\n    - name: \u0022skywalking\u0022\n      skywalking:\n        service: tracing.istio-system.svc.cluster.local\n        port: 11800\nEOF\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## Deploy Apache SkyWalking\n\nIstio 1.16 supports distributed tracing using Apache SkyWalking. Install SkyWalking by executing the following code:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl apply -f \nhttps:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/istio\/istio\/release-1.16\/samples\/addons\/extras\/skywalking.yaml\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nIt will install the following components under the *istio-system* namespace:\n\n- SkyWalking Observability Analysis Platform (OAP): Used to receive trace data, supports SkyWalking native data formats, Zipkin v1 and v2 and Jaeger format.\n- UI: Used to query distributed trace data.\n\nFor more information about SkyWalking, please refer to the SkyWalking documentation.\n\n## Deploy the Bookinfo Application\n\nExecute the following command to install the bookinfo application:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled\nkubectl apply -f samples\/bookinfo\/platform\/kube\/bookinfo.yaml\nkubectl apply -f samples\/bookinfo\/networking\/bookinfo-gateway.yaml\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nLaunch the SkyWalking UI:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nistioctl dashboard skywalking\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nFigure 2 shows all the services available in the bookinfo application:\n\n![Figure 2: SkyWalking General Service page](general-service.jpg)\n\nYou can also see information about instances, endpoints, topology, tracing, etc. For example, Figure 3 shows the service topology of the bookinfo application:\n\n![Figure 3: Topology diagram of the Bookinfo application](topology.jpg)\n\nTracing views in SkyWalking can be displayed in a variety of formats, including list, tree, table, and statistics. See Figure 4:\n\n![Figure 4: SkyWalking General Service trace supports multiple display formats](gs-styles.jpg)\n\nTo facilitate our examination, set the sampling rate of the trace to 100%:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl apply -f - \u003c\u003cEOF\napiVersion: telemetry.istio.io\/v1alpha1\nkind: Telemetry\nmetadata:\n  name: mesh-default\n  namespace: istio-system\nspec:\n  tracing:\n  - randomSamplingPercentage: 100.00\nEOF\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n\u003e **Important:** *It’s generally not good practice to set the sampling rate to 100% in a production environment. To avoid the overhead of generating too many trace logs in production, please adjust the sampling strategy (sampling percentage).*\n\n## Uninstall\n\nAfter experimenting, uninstall Istio and SkyWalking by executing the following command.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nsamples\/bookinfo\/platform\/kube\/cleanup.sh\nistioctl unintall --purge\nkubectl delete namespace istio-system\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## Understanding the Bookinfo Tracing Information\n\nNavigate to the General Service tab in the Apache SkyWalking UI, and you can see the trace information for the most recent *istio-ingressgateway* service, as shown in Figure 5. Click on each span to see the details.\n\n![Figure 5: The table view shows the basic information about each span.](span-table.jpg)\n\nSwitching to the list view, you can see the execution order and duration of each span, as shown in Figure 6:\n\n![Figure 6: List display](trace-list.jpg)\n\nYou might want to know why such a straightforward application generates so much span data. Because after we inject the Envoy proxy into the pod, every request between services will be intercepted and processed by Envoy, as shown in Figure 7:\n\n![Figure 7: Envoy intercepts requests to generate a span](span.svg)\n\nThe tracing process is shown in Figure 8:\n\n![Figure 8: Trace of the Bookinfo application](bookinfo-spans-with-time.svg)\n\nWe give each span a label with a serial number, and the time taken is indicated in parentheses. For illustration purposes, we have summarized all spans in the table below.\n\n| No.  | Endpoint     | Total Duration (ms) | Component Duration (ms) | Current Service      | Description                                 |\n| ---- | ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |\n| 1    | \/productpage | 190                 | 0                       | istio-ingressgateway | Envoy Outbound                              |\n| 2    | \/productpage | 190                 | 1                       | istio-ingressgateway | Ingress -\u003e Productpage network transmission |\n| 3    | \/productpage | 189                 | 1                       | productpage          | Envoy Inbound                               |\n| 4    | \/productpage | 188                 | 21                      | productpage          | Application internal processing             |\n| 5    | \/details\/0   | 8                   | 1                       | productpage          | Envoy Outbound                              |\n| 6    | \/details\/0   | 7                   | 3                       | productpage          | Productpage -\u003e Details network transmission |\n| 7    | \/details\/0   | 4                   | 0                       | details              | Envoy Inbound                               |\n| 8    | \/details\/0   | 4                   | 4                       | details              | Application internal processing             |\n| 9    | \/reviews\/0   | 159                 | 0                       | productpage          | Envoy Outbound                              |\n| 10   | \/reviews\/0   | 159                 | 14                      | productpage          | Productpage -\u003e Reviews network transmission |\n| 11   | \/reviews\/0   | 145                 | 1                       | reviews              | Envoy Inbound                               |\n| 12   | \/reviews\/0   | 144                 | 109                     | reviews              | Application internal processing             |\n| 13   | \/ratings\/0   | 35                  | 2                       | reviews              | Envoy Outbound                              |\n| 14   | \/ratings\/0   | 33                  | 16                      | reviews              | Reviews -\u003e Ratings network transmission     |\n| 15   | \/ratings\/0   | 17                  | 1                       | ratings              | Envoy Inbound                               |\n| 16   | \/ratings\/0   | 16                  | 16                      | ratings              | Application internal processing             |\n\nFrom the above information, it can be seen that:\n\n- The total time consumed for this request is 190 ms.\n- In Istio sidecar mode, each traffic flow in and out of the application container must pass through the Envoy proxy once, each time taking 0 to 2 ms.\n- Network requests between Pods take between 1 and 16ms.\n- This is because the data itself has errors and the start time of the Span is not necessarily equal to the end time of the parent Span.\n- We can see that the most time-consuming part is the Reviews application, which takes 109 ms so that we can optimize it for that application.\n\n## Summary\n\nDistributed tracing is an indispensable tool for analyzing performance and troubleshooting modern distributed applications. In this tutorial, we’ve seen how, with just a few minor changes to your application code to propagate tracing headers, Istio makes distributed tracing simple to use. We’ve also reviewed [Apache SkyWalking](https:\/\/skywalking.apache.org\/) as one of the best distributed tracing systems that Istio supports. It is a fully functional platform for cloud native application analytics, with features such as metrics and log collection, alerting, Kubernetes monitoring, [service mesh performance diagnosis using eBPF](https:\/\/skywalking.apache.org\/blog\/diagnose-service-mesh-network-performance-with-ebpf\/), and more.\n\n---\n\nIf you’re new to service mesh and Kubernetes security, we have a bunch of free online courses [available at Tetrate Academy](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/academy) that will quickly get you up to speed with Istio and Envoy.\n\nIf you’re looking for a fast way to get to production with Istio, check out [Tetrate Istio Distribution (TID)](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/tid). TID is Tetrate’s hardened, fully upstream Istio distribution, with FIPS-verified builds and support available. It’s a great way to get started with Istio knowing you have a trusted distribution to begin with, have an expert team supporting you, and also have the option to get to FIPS compliance quickly if you need to.\n\nOnce you have Istio up and running, you will probably need simpler ways to manage and secure your services beyond what’s available in Istio, that’s where Tetrate Service Bridge comes in. You can learn more about how Tetrate Service Bridge makes service mesh more secure, manageable, and resilient [here](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/tsb), or [contact us for a quick demo](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/contact).\n\n*This blog was originally published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/how-to-use-skywalking-for-distributed-tracing-in-istio\/).*\n', '\/en\/blog\/distributed-tracing-with-skywalking-in-istio\/')">

Based on my testing, the procedures outlined in this article cannot be executed on v1.5.4 or later due to a series of authentication failures.\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\nIn the [previous blog](\/blog\/istio-certificates-management\/), I discussed how certificates are managed in Istio. This article will guide you on how to use an external CA by integrating [SPIRE](https:\/\/spiffe.io\/) and [cert-manager](https:\/\/cert-manager.io\/) to achieve fine-grained certificate management and automatic certificate rotation.\n\nIf you are not familiar with what SPIRE is and why we use SPIRE, I recommend you read the following:\n\n- [Why does Istio use SPIRE for authentication?](\/en\/blog\/why-istio-need-spire\/)\n- [How to integrate SPIRE in Istio?](\/en\/blog\/how-to-integrate-spire-with-istio\/)\n\n## Overview of Certificate Issuance and Management Process\n\nThe diagram below shows the certificate trust chain used in this article based on cert-manager and SPIRE:\n\n![Certificate trust chain based on cert-manager and SPIRE](spire-chain-tree.svg)\n\nFrom the diagram, you can see:\n\n- cert-manager acts as the Root CA, issuing certificates to *istiod* and SPIRE. We use a [self-signed Issuer](https:\/\/cert-manager.io\/docs\/configuration\/selfsigned\/), but you can also configure it to use built-in Issuers like Let\u0027s Encrypt, Vault, Venafi, or other external Issuers. Additionally, you can choose other [UpstreamAuthorities](https:\/\/spiffe.io\/docs\/latest\/deploying\/spire_server\/) such as Vault or SPIRE federations;\n- SPIRE issues SVID certificates to Istio mesh workloads and Ingress Gateway, Egress Gateway for inter-service mTLS;\n- Certificates used by the mesh-external access to the Ingress Gateway and those used by the Egress Gateway to access external services of the mesh need additional configuration;\n\nThe diagram below shows the certificate issuance and renewal process after integrating SPIRE and cert-manager in Istio.\n\n![Istio integration with SPIRE and cert-manager for certificate issuance and renewal](cert-manager-spire-istio.svg)\n\n1. The SPIRE Controller Manager in the SPIRE Server automatically registers workloads in Kubernetes, generating SPIFFE-standard identities for all workloads;\n2. cert-manager issues and manages CA certificates for *istiod*;\n3. The Envoy proxy in the workload sends a CSR request to the SPIRE Agent on the same node via a UNIX Domain Socket (UDS) through the SDS API;\n4. The SPIRE Agent sends the CSR to the SPIRE Server;\n5. The SPIRE Server returns the signed certificate to the SPIRE Agent;\n6. The SPIRE Agent returns the signed certificate to the workload;\n7. SPIRE manages and updates the certificates for the workloads;\n\nAfter understanding the general process, we will install the components in sequence. Versions of the components are as follows:\n\n- cert-manager v1.15.1\n- SPIRE v1.2.0\n- Istio v1.21.1\n\n## Installing cert-manager\n\nRun the following command to install cert-manager, which we will use to achieve automatic certificate rotation:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl apply -f https:\/\/github.com\/cert-manager\/cert-manager\/releases\/download\/v1.15.1\/cert-manager.yaml\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThe Root CA uses a self-signed certificate, run the following command to configure the Root CA:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\ncat \u003c\u003c EOF | kubectl apply -f -\n---\napiVersion: cert-manager.io\/v1\nkind: Issuer\nmetadata:\n  name: selfsigned\n  namespace: cert-manager\nspec:\n  selfSigned: {}\n---\napiVersion: cert-manager.io\/v1\nkind: Certificate\nmetadata:\n  name: selfsigned-ca\n  namespace: cert-manager\nspec:\n  isCA: true\n  duration: 21600h\n  secretName: selfsigned-ca\n  commonName: certmanager-ca\n  subject:\n    organizations:\n      - cert-manager\n  issuerRef:\n    name: selfsigned\n    kind: Issuer\n    group: cert-manager.io\n---\napiVersion: cert-manager.io\/v1\nkind: ClusterIssuer\nmetadata:\n  name: selfsigned-ca\nspec:\n  ca:\n    secretName: selfsigned-ca\nEOF\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThen configure a certificate for *istiod*:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\nkubectl create namespace istio-system\ncat \u003c\u003c EOF | kubectl apply -f -\n---\napiVersion: cert-manager.io\/v1\nkind: Certificate\nmetadata:\n  name: cacerts\n  namespace: istio-system\nspec:\n  secretName: cacerts\n  duration: 1440h\n  renewBefore: 360h\n  commonName: istiod.istio-system.svc\n  isCA: true\n  usages:\n    - digital signature\n    - key encipherment\n    - cert sign\n  dnsNames:\n    - istiod.istio-system.svc\n  issuerRef:\n    name: selfsigned-ca\n    kind: ClusterIssuer\n    group: cert-manager.io\nEOF\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nNow that we have installed cert-manager and created a \u0060clusterIssuer\u0060 named \u0060selfsigned-ca\u0060, next, we will install SPIRE and set cert-manager as SPIRE’s [\u0060UpstreamAuthority\u0060](https:\/\/github.com\/spiffe\/spire\/blob\/main\/doc\/plugin_server_upstreamauthority_cert_manager.md).\n\n## Installing SPIRE\n\nRun the following command to quickly install SPIRE:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl apply -f https:\/\/jimmysong.io\/blog\/cert-manager-spire-istio\/manifests\/spire-with-cert-manager-upstream-authority-quick-start.yaml\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThis YAML file includes adaptations for cert-manager compared to the [\u0060samples\/security\/spire\/spire-quickstart.yaml\u0060](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/istio\/istio\/release-1.22\/samples\/security\/spire\/spire-quickstart.yaml) file in the Istio installation package, such as:\n\n- Adding permissions for the \u0060cert-manager.io\u0060 API group to the \u0060spire-server-cluster-role\u0060 ClusterRole;\n- Adding the \u0060UpstreamAuthority \u0022cert-manager\u0022\u0060 configuration in the SPIRE Server settings;\n\n{{\u003ccallout note \u0022Note\u0022\u003e}}\nThe \u0060trust_domain\u0060 in the SPIRE Server configuration should match the \u0060TRUST_DOMAIN\u0060 environment variable specified when installing Istio.\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\nThis command installs the SPIRE Controller Manager, which automatically registers workloads in Kubernetes.

You can also integrate cert-manager with certificate providers, such as [Let’s Encrypt](https:\/\/letsencrypt.org\/), [HashiCorp Vault](https:\/\/www.vaultproject.io\/), [Venafi](https:\/\/www.venafi.com\/), etc. You can also use [*istio-csr*](https:\/\/github.com\/cert-manager\/istio-csr) to let the *cert-manager* manage certificates in Istio directly. Or [use Vault to store certificates](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/how-to-use-hashicorp-vault-as-a-more-secure-way-to-store-istio-certificates\/).\n\n---\n\n*This blog was originally published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/managing-certificates-in-istio-with-cert-manager-and-spire\/).*', '\/en\/blog\/cert-manager-spire-istio\/')">

This reduces the attack surface of network communication by using strong identities to establish encrypted channels between workloads within the mesh that are both confidential and tamper-resistant. mTLS is a key component for building zero-trust application networks. To understand mTLS traffic encryption in Istio, this article will cover the following:\n\n- An overview of TLS, mTLS, and TLS termination\n- An introduction to howTLS encryption works in Istio\n- How to use Istio to implement mTLS in Kubernetes\n- A discussion of when you do and don’t need mTLS\n\n## What Is TLS and mTLS?\n\nTLS, the successor to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), is a widely adopted security protocol used to create authenticated and encrypted connections between networked computers. For this reason, people often use the terms TLS and SSL interchangeably. In this article, we will refer to them collectively as TLS. TLS 1.0 was released in 1999, and the latest version is 1.3 (released in August 2018); versions 1.0 and 1.1 are deprecated.\n\nThe HTTPS we see when browsing the web uses TLS, as shown in Figure 1, which is built on top of TCP as the session layer in the OSI model. To ensure compatibility, TLS usually uses port 443, but you can use any port you want.\n\n![Figure 1: HTTP vs. HTTPS](http-vs-https.svg)\n\nTLS encryption is required when a client needs to confirm the identity of the server in order to guard against man-in-the-middle attacks and ensure communication security. Figure 2 shows how TLS-encrypted communication proceeds.\n\n![Figure 2: simplified TLS handshake flow](tls-flow.svg)\n\n1. The server applies for and obtains a certificate (X.509 certificate) from a trusted [certificate authority](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Certificate_authority) (CA).\n2. A request from the client to the server containing information such as the TLS version and password combination supported by the client.\n3. The server responds to the client request and attaches a digital certificate.\n4. The client verifies the status, validity, and digital signature of the certificate and confirms the identity of the server.\n5. Encrypted communication commences between the client and the server using a shared private key.\n\nThe above is only an outline description of the TLS communication flow. If you’re interested in the details, please see [this in-depth discussion of the complete TLS handshake process.](https:\/\/www.cloudflare.com\/learning\/ssl\/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake\/)\n\nFrom the above process, you will find that the certificate is the critical element representing the server’s identity. The server must use a certificate issued by an authoritatively certified CA in order to provide public services over the Internet. In contrast, you can manage certificates using your own public key infrastructure (PKI) for services inside of a private environment.\n\nMutual TLS, also referred to as mTLS, is the use of a two-way encrypted channel between a server and a client that necessitates certificate exchange and identity authentication between the parties.\n\n## What Is TLS Termination?\n\nTLS termination is the process of decrypting TLS-encrypted traffic before it is forwarded to a web server. Offloading TLS traffic to an ingress gateway or specialized device improves web application performance while securing encrypted traffic. TLS termination is typically implemented at cluster ingress. All communication between the ingress and servers in the cluster will be conducted directly over HTTP in plaintext, enhancing service performance.\n\n![Figure 3: TLS termination](tls-termination.svg)\n\nBy default, Istio enables mTLS for mesh-based services and ends TLS at the ingress gateway. Furthermore, you can pass through traffic to back-end services for processing.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: networking.istio.io\/v1beta1\nkind: Gateway\nmetadata:\n  name: sample-gateway\nspec:\n  servers:\n  - port:\n      number: 443\n      name: https\n      protocol: HTTPS\n    tls:\n      mode: PASSTHROUGH\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nSee [Gateway TLS Configuration](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/ops\/configuration\/traffic-management\/tls-configuration\/#gateways) for details.\n\n## How to Implement Automatic mTLS in Istio\n\nFigure 4 depicts the security architecture of Istio. This figure clearly shows that at the entry point, JSON Web Token (JWT) \u002b TLS authentication and encryption are used, and that mTLS is enabled between all services within the Istio mesh.\n\n![Istio 安全架构图](istio-security.svg)\n\nIstio includes a built-in CA, and [Secret Discovery Service (SDS)](https:\/\/www.envoyproxy.io\/docs\/envoy\/latest\/configuration\/security\/secret)—one of the discovery services in Envoy [xDS](https:\/\/www.envoyproxy.io\/docs\/envoy\/latest\/api-docs\/xds_protocol)—enables the issuance and rotation of SVID certificates. The mTLS flow in the Istio mesh is as follows:\n\n1. The sidecar of every service requests a certificate from Istiod on behalf of the workload at startup, and Istiod issues the [SVID](https:\/\/spiffe.io\/docs\/latest\/spiffe-about\/spiffe-concepts\/#spiffe-verifiable-identity-document-svid) certificate (the process is more complex, and I will explain it in a future blog).\n2. The sidecar of every workload intercepts all client requests within the pod.\n3. The client sidecar starts an mTLS handshake with the server sidecar. During the handshake, the [JWT](https:\/\/www.envoyproxy.io\/docs\/envoy\/latest\/intro\/arch_overview\/security\/jwt_authn_filter) and [authentication filter](https:\/\/www.envoyproxy.io\/docs\/envoy\/latest\/intro\/arch_overview\/security\/ext_authz_filter) in the client sidecar will authenticate the identity of the request, and store the identity in the filter metadata after the authentication. Then the request will go through the authorization filter to determine if the request is allowed.\n4. If the request is authenticated and authorized, the client and the server start to establish a connection for communication.\n\nIn Istio, authentication and authorization between services can be configured using one of three resource objects:\n\n- **[RequestAuthentication](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/reference\/config\/security\/request_authentication\/):** To specify the service’s only currently supported request-level authentication method, JWT.\n- **[PeerAuthentication](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/reference\/config\/security\/peer_authentication\/):** To enable mTLS or plaintext requests, set the transport authentication mode.\n- **[AuthorizationPolicy](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/reference\/config\/security\/authorization-policy\/):** To specify who can do what when traffic between services is authorized? For instance, subject A either permits (ALLOW) or forbids (DENY) traffic from subject B.\n\n## How to Enable Automatic mTLS in Istio\n\nIn PeerAuthentication, you can specify the mTLS mode that will be used for the target workload. Peer authentication is supported in the following modes:\n\n- PERMISSIVE: The workload’s default setting that allows it to accept either mTLS or plain text traffic.\n- STRICT: The workload accepts only mTLS traffic.\n- DISABLE: Disable mTLS. From a security perspective, mTLS should not be disabled unless you have your own security solution.\n- UNSET: Inherited from the parent, with the following priority: service specific \u003e namespace scope \u003e mesh scope setting.\n\nIstio’s peer authentication uses *PERMISSIVE* mode by default, automatically sending *mTLS* traffic to these workloads and clear text traffic to workloads without a sidecar. After including Kubernetes services in the Istio mesh, we can use *PERMISSIVE* mode first to prevent services from failing *mTLS*. We can use one of two ways to enable strict mTLS mode for certain services:\n\n- Use PeerAuthentication to define how traffic is transferred between sidecars.\n- Use DestinationRule to define the TLS settings in the traffic routing policy.\n\nThe reviews service’s mTLS configuration in the default namespace can be seen in the example below.\n\n### Use PeerAuthentication to Set mTLS for Workloads\n\nFor instance, the following configuration can be used to specify that a workload under a namespace has strict mTLS enabled.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: security.istio.io\/v1beta1\nkind: PeerAuthentication\nmetadata:\n  name: foo-peer-policy\n  namespace: default\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: reviews\n  mtls:\n    mode: STRICT\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nAccording to the [Istio documentation](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/tasks\/security\/authentication\/mtls-migration\/), you can also enable strict mTLS for all services in the mesh by configuring strict mTLS for the namespace istio-system where Istio is installed.\n\n### Use DestinationRule to Set up mTLS for Workloads\n\nTraffic routing policies, such as load balancing, anomaly detection, TLS settings, etc., are set using DestinationRule. In the TLS settings, there are various modes. As shown below, use ISTIO_MUTUAL mode to enable Istio’s workload-based automatic TLS.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: networking.istio.io\/v1beta1\nkind: DestinationRule\nmetadata:\n  name: reviews\n  namespace: default\nspec:\n  host: reviews\n  trafficPolicy:\n    tls:\n      mode: ISTIO_MUTUAL\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## When Should You Use mTLS?\n\nThe short answer is that you should use mTLS for network communication between application components that you have some control over—like between microservices in a cluster.\n\nOne-way TLS is typically used by Internet clients to connect to Web services, which means that only the server needs to show identification and is unconcerned with the identity of the client. One-way TLS allows you to use passwords, tokens, two-factor authentication, and other methods when you need to confirm the identity of the client. However, when using a service mesh, mTLS operates outside the application and doesn’t require many changes to the application logic, whereas such an authentication method requires internal application support.\n\nAs you can see from the example above, mTLS implementation calls for certificate exchange between services. As the number of services rises, managing numerous certificates becomes a laborious task. You can implement automatic mTLS and fix the certificate management issue with the aid of a service mesh.\n\n## When Shouldn’t You Use mTLS?\n\nAlthough mTLS is the preferred protocol for securing inter-service communication in cloud-native applications, implementing mTLS necessitates a more complex, symmetric encryption and decryption process than one-way TLS. In some cases where there is high traffic volume or CPU utilization must be optimized, terminatingTLS at the traffic entry point and turning on mTLS internally for specific services only can help minimize request response times and decrease compute resource consumption for some traffic with lower security levels.\n\nAdditionally, it is necessary to [disable probe rewriting for pods](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/ops\/configuration\/mesh\/app-health-check\/#disable-the-http-probe-rewrite-for-a-pod) when using services that cannot obtain certificates, such as health checks performed via HTTP on Kubelet and the inability to access the service’s health check endpoint via TLS.\n\nFinally, when mesh services access some external services, mTLS is also not necessary.\n\n## Summary\n\nmTLS is a crucial component of creating a zero-trust application network, which makes it possible to encrypt traffic within the mesh. Istio makes it simple to enable automatic mTLS for Kubernetes services, doing away with the need to manage certificates. At the same time, we can selectively enable mTLS for a subset of the mesh’s services, enabling us to move services from Kubernetes to the mesh. In a subsequent blog, we’ll go into more detail about Istio’s certificate management system. Stay tuned.\n\n---\n\nIf you’re new to service mesh and Kubernetes security, we have a bunch of free online courses [available at Tetrate Academy](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/academy) that will quickly get you up to speed with Istio and Envoy.\n\nIf you’re looking for a fast way to get to production with Istio, check out [Tetrate Istio Distribution (TID)](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/tid). TID is Tetrate’s hardened, fully upstream Istio distribution, with FIPS-verified builds and support available. It’s a great way to get started with Istio knowing you have a trusted distribution to begin with, have an expert team supporting you, and also have the option to get to FIPS compliance quickly if you need to.Once you have Istio up and running, you will probably need simpler ways to manage and secure your services beyond what’s available in Istio, that’s where Tetrate Service Bridge comes in. You can learn more about how Tetrate Service Bridge makes service mesh more secure, manageable, and resilient [here](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/tsb), or [contact us for a quick demo](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/contact).\n\n*This blog was originally published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/how-istios-mtls-traffic-encryption-works-as-part-of-a-zero-trust-security-posture\/).*\n', '\/en\/blog\/understanding-the-tls-encryption-in-istio\/')">

It splits the duties currently performed by the Envoy sidecar into two separate components: a node-level component for encryption (called “ztunnel”) and an L7 Envoy instance deployed per service for all other processing (called “waypoint”). The ambient mesh model is an attempt to gain some efficiencies in potentially improved lifecycle and resource management. You can learn more about what ambient mesh is and how it differs from the Sidecar pattern [here](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/ambient-mesh-what-you-need-to-know-about-this-experimental-new-deployment-model-for-istio\/).\n\nThis article takes you step-by-step through a hands-on approach to the transparent traffic intercepting and routing of L4 traffic paths in the Istio’s Ambient mode. If you don’t know what Ambient mode is, [this article](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/ambient-mesh-what-you-need-to-know-about-this-experimental-new-deployment-model-for-istio\/) can help you understand.\n\nIf you want to skip the actual hands-on steps and just want to know the L4 traffic path in Ambient mode, please see the figure below, it shows a Pod of Service A calling a Pod of Service B on a different node below.\n\n![Figure 1: Transparent traffic intercepting and routing in the L4 network of Istio Ambient Mesh](ambient-mesh-l4-traffic-path.svg)\n\n### Principles\n\nAmbient mode uses [tproxy](https:\/\/www.kernel.org\/doc\/Documentation\/networking\/tproxy.txt) and [HTTP Based Overlay Network Environment (HBONE)](https:\/\/pkg.go.dev\/github.com\/costinm\/hbone) as key technologies for transparent traffic intercepting and routing:\n\n- Using tproxy to intercept the traffic from the host Pod into the Ztunnel (Envoy Proxy).\n- Using HBONE to establish a tunnel for passing TCP traffic between Ztunnels.\n\n### What Is tproxy?\n\ntproxy is a transparent proxy supported by the Linux kernel since version 2.2, where the t stands for transparent. You need to enable \u0060NETFILTER_TPROXY\u0060 and policy routing in the kernel configuration. With tproxy, the Linux kernel can act as a router and redirect packets to user space. See the [tproxy documentation](http:\/\/lxr.linux.no\/linux\u002bv3.10\/Documentation\/networking\/tproxy.txt) for details.\n\n### What Is HBONE?\n\nHBONE is a method of providing tunneling capabilities using the HTTP protocol. A client sends an [HTTP CONNECT](https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/HTTP\/Methods\/CONNECT) request (which contains the destination address) to an HTTP proxy server to establish a tunnel, and the proxy server establishes a TCP connection to the destination on behalf of the client, which can then transparently transport TCP data streams to the destination server through the proxy. In Ambient mode, Ztunnel (Envoy inside) acts as a transparent proxy, using [Envoy Internal Listener](https:\/\/www.envoyproxy.io\/docs\/envoy\/latest\/configuration\/other_features\/internal_listener) to receive HTTP CONNECT requests and pass TCP streams to the upstream cluster.\n\n## Environment\n\nBefore starting the hands-on, it is necessary to explain the demo environment, and the corresponding object names in this article:\n\n| Items             | Name                                           | IP            |\n| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :------------ |\n| Service A Pod     | \u0060sleep-5644bdc767-2dfg7\u0060                       | 10.4.4.19     |\n| Service B Pod     | \u0060productpage-v1-5586c4d4ff-qxz9f\u0060              | 10.4.3.20     |\n| Ztunnel A Pod     | \u0060ztunnel-rts54\u0060                                | 10.4.4.18     |\n| Ztunnel B Pod     | \u0060ztunnel-z4qmh\u0060                                | 10.4.3.14     |\n| Node A            | \u0060gke-jimmy-cluster-default-pool-d5041909-d10i\u0060 | 10.168.15.222 |\n| Node B            | \u0060gke-jimmy-cluster-default-pool-d5041909-c1da\u0060 | 10.168.15.224 |\n| Service B Cluster | \u0060productpage\u0060                                  | 10.8.14.226   |\n\nBecause these names will be used in subsequent command lines, the text will use pronouns, so that you can experiment in your own environment.\n\nFor the tutorial, I installed Istio Ambient mode in GKE. You can refer to this [Istio blog post](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2022\/get-started-ambient\/) for installation instructions. Be careful not to install the Gateway, so as not to enable the L7 functionality; otherwise, the traffic path will be different from the descriptions in this blog.\n\nIn the following, we will experiment and dive into the L4 traffic path of a pod of \u0060sleep\u0060 service to a pod of \u0060productpage\u0060 service on different nodes. We will look at the outbound and inbound traffic of the Pods separately.\n\n## Outbound Traffic Intercepting\n\nThe transparent traffic intercepting process for outbound traffic from a pod in Ambient mesh is as follows:\n\n1. Istio CNI creates the \u0060istioout\u0060 NIC and iptables rules on the node, adds the Pods’ IP in Ambient mesh to the [IP set](https:\/\/ipset.netfilter.org\/), and transparently intercepts outbound traffic from Ambient mesh to \u0060pistioout\u0060 virtual NIC through [Geneve (Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation)](https:\/\/datatracker.ietf.org\/doc\/rfc8926\/) tunnels with netfilter \u0060nfmark\u0060 tags and routing rules.\n2. The init container in Ztunnel creates iptables rules that forward all traffic from the \u0060pistioout\u0060 NIC to port 15001 of the Envoy proxy in Ztunnel.\n3. Envoy processes the packets and establishes an HBONE tunnel (HTTP CONNECT) with the upstream endpoints to forward the packets upstream.\n\n### Check The Routing Rules On Node A\n\nLog in to Node A, where Service A is located, and use \u0060iptables-save\u0060 to check the rules.\n\n{{\u003chighlight bash \u0022linenos=table,hl_lines=3 4 6 35\u0022\u003e}}\n$ iptables-save\n\/* omit *\/\n-A PREROUTING -j ztunnel-PREROUTING\n-A PREROUTING -m comment --comment \u0022kubernetes service portals\u0022 -j KUBE-SERVICES\n-A ztunnel-POSTROUTING -m mark --mark 0x100\/0x100 -j ACCEPT\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -m mark --mark 0x100\/0x100 -j ACCEPT\n\/* omit *\/\n*mangle\n\/* omit *\/\n-A PREROUTING -j ztunnel-PREROUTING\n-A INPUT -j ztunnel-INPUT\n-A FORWARD -j ztunnel-FORWARD\n-A OUTPUT -j ztunnel-OUTPUT\n-A OUTPUT -s 169.254.169.254\/32 -j DROP\n-A POSTROUTING -j ztunnel-POSTROUTING\n-A ztunnel-FORWARD -m mark --mark 0x220\/0x220 -j CONNMARK --save-mark --nfmask 0x220 --ctmask 0x220\n-A ztunnel-FORWARD -m mark --mark 0x210\/0x210 -j CONNMARK --save-mark --nfmask 0x210 --ctmask 0x210\n-A ztunnel-INPUT -m mark --mark 0x220\/0x220 -j CONNMARK --save-mark --nfmask 0x220 --ctmask 0x220\n-A ztunnel-INPUT -m mark --mark 0x210\/0x210 -j CONNMARK --save-mark --nfmask 0x210 --ctmask 0x210\n-A ztunnel-OUTPUT -s 10.4.4.1\/32 -j MARK --set-xmark 0x220\/0xffffffff\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -i istioin -j MARK --set-xmark 0x200\/0x200\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -i istioin -j RETURN\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -i istioout -j MARK --set-xmark 0x200\/0x200\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -i istioout -j RETURN\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -p udp -m udp --dport 6081 -j RETURN\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -m connmark --mark 0x220\/0x220 -j MARK --set-xmark 0x200\/0x200\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -m mark --mark 0x200\/0x200 -j RETURN\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING ! -i veth300a1d80 -m connmark --mark 0x210\/0x210 -j MARK --set-xmark 0x40\/0x40\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -m mark --mark 0x40\/0x40 -j RETURN\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING ! -s 10.4.4.18\/32 -i veth300a1d80 -j MARK --set-xmark 0x210\/0x210\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -m mark --mark 0x200\/0x200 -j RETURN\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -i veth300a1d80 -j MARK --set-xmark 0x220\/0x220\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -p udp -j MARK --set-xmark 0x220\/0x220\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -m mark --mark 0x200\/0x200 -j RETURN\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -p tcp -m set --match-set ztunnel-pods-ips src -j MARK --set-xmark 0x100\/0x100\n{{\u003c\/highlight\u003e}}\n\nIPtables rule descriptions:\n\n- Line 3: the \u0060PREROUTING\u0060 chain is the first to run, and all packets will go to the \u0060ztunnel-PEROUTING\u0060 chain first.\n- Line 4: packets are sent to the \u0060KUBE-SERVICES\u0060 chain, where the Cluster IP of the Kubernetes Service is DNAT’d to the Pod IP.\n- Line 6: packets with \u00600x100\/0x100\u0060 flags pass through the \u0060PREROUTING\u0060 chain and no longer go through the \u0060KUBE-SERVICES\u0060 chain.\n- Line 35: this is the last rule added to the \u0060ztunnel-PREROUTING\u0060 chain; all TCP packets entering the \u0060ztunnel-PREROUTING\u0060 chain that are in the \u0060ztunnel-pods-ips\u0060 [IP set](https:\/\/ipset.netfilter.org\/) (created by the Istio CNI) are marked with 0x100\/0x100, which overrides all previous marks. See the [Netfilter documentation](https:\/\/ipset.netfilter.org\/iptables-extensions.man.html#lbDD) for more information about \u0060nfmark\u0060.\n\nBy implementing the above iptables rules, we can ensure that ambient mesh only intercepts packets from the \u0060ztunnel-pods-ips\u0060 IP set pods and marks the packets with \u00600x100\/0x100\u0060 (\u0060nfmark\u0060, in value\/mask format, both value and mask are 32-bit binary integers) without affecting other pods.\n\nLet’s look at the routing rules for this node.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\n$ ip rule\n0:      from all lookup local\n100:    from all fwmark 0x200\/0x200 goto 32766\n101:    from all fwmark 0x100\/0x100 lookup 101\n102:    from all fwmark 0x40\/0x40 lookup 102\n103:    from all lookup 100\n32766:  from all lookup main\n32767:  from all lookup default\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThe routing table will be executed sequentially, with the first column indicating the priority of the routing table and the second column indicating the routing table to look for or jump to. You will see that all packets marked with \u00600x100\/0x100\u0060 will look for the 101 routing table. Let’s look at that routing table.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\n$ ip route show table 101\ndefault via 192.168.127.2 dev istioout \n10.4.4.18 dev veth52b75946 scope link \n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nYou will see the 101 routing table with the keyword via, which indicates that the packets will be transmitted through the gateway, [see the usage of the ip route command](http:\/\/linux-ip.net\/html\/tools-ip-route.html#tools-ip-route-show). All packets are sent through the \u0060istioout\u0060 NIC to the gateway (IP is \u0060192.168.127.2\u0060).

Let’s see how Ztunnel routes outbound traffic.\n\n\u003e Note: The Envoy filter rules in Ztunnel are completely different from the Envoy filter rules in Sidecar mode, so instead of using the \u0060istioctl proxy-config\u0060 command to inspect the configuration of Listener, Cluster, Endpoint, etc., we directly export the complete Envoy configuration in Ztunnel.\n\nYou can get the Envoy configuration in Ztunnel A directly and remotely on your local machine\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl exec -n istio-system ztunnel-hptxk -c istio-proxy -- curl \u0022127.0.0.1:15000\/config_dump?include_eds\u0022\u003eztunnel-a-all-include-eds.json\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n\u003e Note: Do not use \u0060istioctl proxy-config all ztunnel-rts54 -n istio-system\u0060 command to get the Envoy configuration, because the configuration so obtained does not contain the EDS part. The exported JSON file will have tens of thousands of lines, so it is recommended to use [fx](https:\/\/github.com\/antonmedv\/fx) or other tools to parse the file for readability.\n\n### Ztunnel_outbound Listener\n\nThe Envoy configuration contains the traffic rule configuration for all pods on this node.

The \u0060set_dst_address\u0060 filter sets the upstream address to the downstream destination address.\n\n### HBONE Tunnel Endpoints For The Sleep Cluster\n\nLet’s look into the configuration of the \u0060outbound_tunnel_clus_spiffe:\/\/cluster.local\/ns\/default\/sa\/sleep cluster\u0060.\n\n{{\u003chighlight json \u0022linenos=table,hl_lines=6 22-41 45-47\u0022\u003e}}\n {\n \u0022version_info\u0022: \u00222022-11-11T07:30:10Z\/37\u0022,\n \u0022cluster\u0022: {\n  \u0022@type\u0022: \u0022type.googleapis.com\/envoy.config.cluster.v3.Cluster\u0022,\n  \u0022name\u0022: \u0022outbound_pod_tunnel_clus_spiffe:\/\/cluster.local\/ns\/default\/sa\/sleep\u0022,\n  \u0022type\u0022: \u0022ORIGINAL_DST\u0022,\n  \u0022connect_timeout\u0022: \u00222s\u0022,\n  \u0022lb_policy\u0022: \u0022CLUSTER_PROVIDED\u0022,\n  \u0022cleanup_interval\u0022: \u002260s\u0022,\n  \u0022transport_socket\u0022: {\n   \u0022name\u0022: \u0022envoy.transport_sockets.tls\u0022,\n   \u0022typed_config\u0022: {\n    \u0022@type\u0022: \u0022type.googleapis.com\/envoy.extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.UpstreamTlsContext\u0022,\n    \u0022common_tls_context\u0022: {\n     \u0022tls_params\u0022: {\n      \u0022tls_minimum_protocol_version\u0022: \u0022TLSv1_3\u0022,\n      \u0022tls_maximum_protocol_version\u0022: \u0022TLSv1_3\u0022\n     },\n     \u0022alpn_protocols\u0022: [\n      \u0022h2\u0022\n     ],\n     \u0022tls_certificate_sds_secret_configs\u0022: [\n      {\n       \u0022name\u0022: \u0022spiffe:\/\/cluster.local\/ns\/default\/sa\/sleep~sleep-5644bdc767-2dfg7~85c8c34e-7ae3-4d29-9582-0819e2b10c69\u0022,\n       \u0022sds_config\u0022: {\n        \u0022api_config_source\u0022: {\n         \u0022api_type\u0022: \u0022GRPC\u0022,\n         \u0022grpc_services\u0022: [\n          {\n           \u0022envoy_grpc\u0022: {\n            \u0022cluster_name\u0022: \u0022sds-grpc\u0022\n           }\n          }\n         ],\n         \u0022set_node_on_first_message_only\u0022: true,\n         \u0022transport_api_version\u0022: \u0022V3\u0022\n        },\n        \u0022resource_api_version\u0022: \u0022V3\u0022\n       }\n      }\n     ]\n    }\n   }\n  },\n  \u0022original_dst_lb_config\u0022: {\n   \u0022upstream_port_override\u0022: 15008\n  },\n  \u0022typed_extension_protocol_options\u0022: {\n   \u0022envoy.extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions\u0022: {\n    \u0022@type\u0022: \u0022type.googleapis.com\/envoy.extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions\u0022,\n    \u0022explicit_http_config\u0022: {\n     \u0022http2_protocol_options\u0022: {\n      \u0022allow_connect\u0022: true\n     }\n    }\n   }\n  }\n },\n \u0022last_updated\u0022: \u00222022-11-11T07:30:10.754Z\u0022\n}\n{{\u003c\/highlight\u003e}}\n\nDescriptions:\n\n- Line 6: the type of this cluster is \u0060ORIGINAL_DST\u0060, i.e. the address 10.4.3.20:9080 obtained by EDS in the previous section.\n- Lines 22 – 41: the upstream TLS certificate is configured.\n- lines 45 – 48: the upstream port is overridden with 15008.\n\nThe above is the whole process of transparent outbound traffic intercepting using tproxy and HBONE tunnel.\n\n## Inbound Traffic Intercepting\n\nNode B receives requests from Node A to \u006010.4.3.20:15008\u0060. Inbound traffic intercepting in Ambient mode is similar to outbound. It also uses tproxy and HBONE to achieve transparent traffic intercepting.\n\nThe transparent traffic intercepting process for inbound traffic to the pod of Ambient mesh is as follows:\n\n1. Istio CNI creates the istioin NIC and iptables rules on the node, adds the pods IP in Ambient mesh to the IP set, and transparently hijacks outbound traffic from Ambient mesh to the pistioin VM through the Geneve tunnel by using Netfilter nfmark tags and routing rules. NICs.\n2. The init container in Ztunnel creates iptables rules that forward all traffic from the pistioin NIC to port 15008 of the Envoy proxy in Ztunnel.\n3. Envoy processes the packets and forwards them to Pod B.\n\nSince the checking procedure is similar to the outbound traffic, some of the output will be omitted below.\n\n### Check the Routing Rules on Node B\n\nLog in to Node B, where Service B is located, and check the iptables on the node:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\n$ iptables-save\n\/* omit *\/\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -m mark --mark 0x200\/0x200 -j RETURN\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -p tcp -m set --match-set ztunnel-pods-ips src -j MARK --set-xmark 0x100\/0x100\n\/* omit *\/\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nYou will see the previous command mentioned in the previous section to mark all packets sent by the pods in the \u0060ztunnel-pods-ips\u0060 IP set with 0x100\/0x100: mark all packets with 0x200\/0x200, and then continue with iptables.\n\nLook into the routing table on node B:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\n0:      from all lookup local\n100:    from all fwmark 0x200\/0x200 goto 32766\n101:    from all fwmark 0x100\/0x100 lookup 101\n102:    from all fwmark 0x40\/0x40 lookup 102\n103:    from all lookup 100\n32766:  from all lookup main\n32767:  from all lookup default\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThe number of routing tables and rules are the same in all the nodes which belong to the ambient mesh. The routing table rules will be executed sequentially, looking first for the local table, then all packets with \u00600x200\/0x200\u0060 flags will first jump to the main table (where veth routes are defined), and then to the 100 table, where the following rules are in place:\n\n{{\u003chighlight bash \u0022linenos=table,hl_lines=8\u0022\u003e}}\n$ ip route show table 100\n10.4.3.14 dev veth28865c45 scope link \n10.4.3.15 via 192.168.126.2 dev istioin src 10.4.3.1\n10.4.3.16 via 192.168.126.2 dev istioin src 10.4.3.1\n10.4.3.17 via 192.168.126.2 dev istioin src 10.4.3. \n10.4.3.18 via 192.168.126.2 dev istioin src 10.4.3. \n10.4.3.19 via 192.168.126.2 dev istioin src 10.4.3.1\n10.4.3.20 via 192.168.126.2 dev istioin src 10.4.3.1\n{{\u003c\/highlight\u003e}}\n\nYou will see that packets destined for \u006010.4.3.20\u0060 will be routed to the \u0060192.168.126.2\u0060 gateway on the istioin NIC.\n\nLook into the details of the istioin NIC:\n\n{{\u003chighlight bash \u0022linenos=table,hl_lines=4 5\u0022\u003e}}\n$ ip -d addr show istioin \n17: istioin: \u003cBROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP\u003e mtu 1410 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default \n    link\/ether 36:2a:2f:f1:5c:97 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff promiscuity 0 minmtu 68 maxmtu 65485 \n    geneve id 1000 remote 10.4.3.14 ttl auto dstport 6081 noudpcsum udp6zerocsumrx numtxqueues 1 numrxqueues 1 gso_max_size 65536 gso_max_segs 65535 \n    inet 192.168.126.1\/30 brd 192.168.126.3 scope global istioin\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n    inet6 fe80::342a:2fff:fef1:5c97\/64 scope link \n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n{{\u003c\/highlight\u003e}}\n\nAs you can see from the output, \u0060istioin\u0060 is a Geneve-type virtual NIC that creates a Geneve tunnel with a remote IP of \u006010.4.3.14\u0060, which is the Pod IP of Ztunnel B.\n\n###  Check The Routing Rules On Ztunnel B Pod\n\nGo to the Ztunnel B Pod and use the \u0060ip -d a\u0060 command to check its NIC information.

Let’s look at how Ztunnel routes inbound traffic.\n\nLet’s remotely get the Envoy configuration in Ztunnel B directly on our local machine.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl exec -n istio-system

The above is the flow of L4 traffic hijacking and routing between nodes in Ambient mode.\n\n## Summary\n\nFor demonstration purposes, this article shows the paths of L4 network access packets for services on different nodes, even if the paths are similar for two services on the same node. Istio’s Ambient mode is still in its infancy, and during my testing, I also found that the EDS in the exported Envoy configuration was missing the cluster_name field. After understanding the L4 traffic path, I will share the L7 traffic path in Ambient mode in the future. Stay tuned.\n\n---\n\nIf you’re new to service mesh and Kubernetes security, we have a bunch of free online courses [available at Tetrate Academy](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/academy) that will quickly get you up to speed with Istio and Envoy.\n\nIf you’re looking for a fast way to get to production with Istio, check out [Tetrate Istio Distribution (TID)](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/tid) . TID is Tetrate’s hardened, fully upstream Istio distribution, with FIPS-verified builds and support available. It’s a great way to get started with Istio knowing you have a trusted distribution to begin with, have an expert team supporting you, and also have the option to get to FIPS compliance quickly if you need to.Once you have Istio up and running, you will probably need simpler ways to manage and secure your services beyond what’s available in Istio, that’s where Tetrate Service Bridge comes in. You can learn more about how Tetrate Service Bridge makes service mesh more secure, manageable, and resilient [here](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/tsb) , or [contact us for a quick demo](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/contact) .\n\n*This blog was originally published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/transparent-traffic-intercepting-and-routing-in-the-l4-network-of-istio-ambient-mesh\/).*\n', '\/en\/blog\/ambient-mesh-l4-traffic-path\/')">

With CNCF’s strong community and marketing resources, and Ambient Mesh further lowering the barrier to trying Istio, the five year old open source project has been revitalized.\n\nIf you don’t know about service mesh and Istio, or are curious about the future of Istio, this eBook—[The Current State and Future of the Istio Service Mesh](https:\/\/www.tetrate-old.local\/get-insights-into-history-and-future-of-istio-content\/) will give you the answers. The following is an excerpt from the book. In my view, the future of Istio lies in being the infrastructure for zero-trust network and hybrid cloud.\n\n## Zero Trust\n\nZero trust is an important topic, including when I spoke at IstioCon 2022. Istio is becoming an important part of zero trust, the most important element of which is identity-oriented control rather than network-oriented control.\n\n### What Is Zero Trust?\n\nZero trust is a security philosophy, not a best practice that all security teams follow in the same way. The concept of zero trust was proposed to bring a more secure network to the cloud-native world. Zero trust is a theoretical state where all consumers within a network not only have no authority but also have no awareness of the surrounding network. The main challenges of zero trust are the increasingly granular authorization and the need for a time limit for user authorization.\n\n## Authentication\n\nIstio 1.14 adds support for the SPIFFE Runtime Environment (SPIRE). SPIRE, a CNCF incubation project, is an implementation of the Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone (SPIFFE), also a CNCF Incubation Project. In Kubernetes, we use ServiceAccount to provide identity information for workloads in Pods, and its core is based on Token (using Secret resource storage) to represent workload identity. A token is a resource in a Kubernetes cluster. How to unify the identities of multiple clusters and workloads running in non-Kubernetes environments (such as virtual machines)? That’s what SPIFFE is trying to solve.\n\nThe purpose of SPIFFE is to establish an open and unified workload identity standard based on the concept of zero trust, which helps to establish a fully identifiable data center network with zero trust. The core of SPIFFE is to define a short-lived encrypted identity document—SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document (SVID)—through a simple API, which is used as an identity document (based on an X.509 certificate or JWT token) for workload authentication. SPIRE can automatically rotate SVID certificates and keys according to administrator-defined policies, dynamically provide workload identities, and Istio can dynamically consume these workload identities through SPIRE.\n\nThe Kubernetes-based SPIRE architecture diagram is shown below.\n\n![Figure 1: SPIRE deployed in Kubernetes](spire.svg)\n\nIstio originally used the Citadel service in Istiod to be responsible for certificate management in the service mesh, and issued the certificate to the data plane through the xDS (to be precise, SDS API) protocol. With SPIRE, the work of certificate management is handed over to SPIRE Server. SPIRE also supports the Envoy SDS API. After we enable SPIRE in Istio, the traffic entering the workload pod will be authenticated once after being transparently intercepted into the sidecar. The purpose of authentication is to compare the identity of the workload with the environment information it runs on (node, Pod’s ServiceAccount and Namespace, etc.) to prevent identity forgery. Please refer to[ How to Integrate SPIRE in Istio](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/ops\/integrations\/spire\/) to learn how to use SPIRE for authentication in Istio.\n\nWe can deploy SPIRE in Kubernetes using the Kubernetes Workload Registrar, which automatically registers the workload in Kubernetes for us and generates an SVID. The registration machine is a Server-Agent architecture, which deploys a SPIRE Agent on each node, and the Agent communicates with the workload through a shared UNIX Domain Socket. The following diagram shows the process of using SPIRE for authentication in Istio.\n\n![Figure 2: SPIRE-based workload authentication process in Istio](spire-auth.svg)\n\nThe steps to using SPIRE for workload authentication in Istio are as follows:\n\n- To obtain the SIVD, the SPIRE Agent is referred to as a pilot-agent via shared UDS.\n- The SPIRE Agent asks Kubernetes (to be precise, the kubelet on the node) for load information.\n- The kubelet returns the information queried from the API server to the workload validator.\n- The validator compares the result returned by the kubelet with the identity information shared by the sidecar. If it is the same, it returns the correct SVID cache to the workload. If it is different, the authentication fails.\n\n Please refer to the SPIRE documentation for the detailed process of registering and authenticating workloads.\n\n## NGAC\n\nWhen each workload has an accurate identity, how can the permissions of these identities be restricted? Role-based access control (RBAC) is used by default in Kubernetes for access control. As the name suggests, this access control is based on roles. Although it is relatively simple to use, there is a role explosion problem for large-scale clusters—that is, there are too many roles, and the types are not static, making it difficult to track and audit role permission models. In addition, the access rights of roles in RBAC are fixed, and there is no provision for short-term use rights; nor does it take into account attributes such as location, time, or equipment. Enterprises using RBAC have difficulty meeting complex access control requirements to comply with the regulatory requirements that other organizations demand.\n\nNGAC, or Next Generation Access Control, takes the approach of modeling access decision data as a graph. NGAC enables a systematic, policy-consistent approach to access control, granting or denying user management capabilities with a high level of granularity. NGAC was developed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and is currently used for rights management in [Tetrate Service Bridge (TSB).](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/tetrate-service-bridge) For more information, read our article on [why you should choose NGAC over ABAC and RBAC](https:\/\/thenewstack.io\/why-you-should-choose-ngac-as-your-access-control-model).\n\n## Hybrid cloud\n\nIn practical applications, we may deploy multiple Kubernetes clusters in various environments for reasons such as load balancing; isolation of development and production environments; decoupling of data processing and data storage; cross-cloud backup and disaster recovery; and avoiding vendor lock-in. The Kubernetes community provides a “cluster federation” function that can help us create a multi-cluster architecture, such as the common Kubernetes multi-cluster architecture shown in the figure below, in which the host cluster serves as the control plane and has two member clusters, namely West and East.\n\n![Figure 3: Kubernetes cluster federation architecture](federation.svg)\n\nCluster federation requires that the networks between the host cluster and member clusters can communicate with each other, but it does not require network connectivity between member clusters. The host cluster serves as the API entry, and all resource requests from the outside world to the host cluster will be forwarded to the member clusters.\n\nThe control plane of the cluster federation is deployed in the host cluster, and the “Push Reconciler” in it will propagate the identities, roles, and role bindings in the federation to all member clusters. Cluster federation simply “connects” multiple clusters together, replicating workloads among multiple clusters, and the traffic between member clusters cannot be scheduled, nor can true multi-tenancy be achieved.\n\nCluster federation is not enough to realize hybrid clouds. In order to realize hybrid clouds in the true sense, it is necessary to achieve interconnection between clusters and realize multi-tenancy at the same time. Tetrate Service Bridge provides a general control plane for multi-cluster management on top of Istio and then adds a management plane to manage multiple clusters, providing functions such as multi-tenancy, management configuration, and observability. Below is a diagram of the multi-tenancy and API of the Istio management plane.\n\n![Figure 4: TSB’s management plane built on top of Istio](tsb.svg)\n\nIn order to manage the hybrid cloud, TSB uses a management plane based on Istio, creates tenant and workspace resources, and applies the gateway group, traffic group, and security group to the workloads in the corresponding cluster through selectors.\n\nTetrate provides an enterprise-level service mesh management plane that works across clusters, across clouds, and with on-premises deployments, including VMs and bare metal servers. At Tetrate, we are committed to building an application-aware network suitable for any environment and any workload and providing a zero-trust hybrid cloud platform. And we contribute to building needed infrastructure in open source wherever possible; only management-plane-specific functionality is reserved for the commercial software offering.\n\nThe figure shown below is the architecture diagram of Tetrate’s flagship product, Tetrate Service Bridge.\n\n![Figure 5: Tetrate Service Bridge architecture](tsb-org.svg)\n\nFor the detailed architecture of TSB, please refer to the [TSB documentation](https:\/\/docs.tetrate.io\/service-bridge).\n\n## Get the eBook\n\nThe above is just a summary of what we see for the future of Istio. To learn more about the historical motivation for the emergence of the service mesh, the evolution of Istio, and the Istio open source ecosystem, please [download the eBook](https:\/\/www.tetrate-old.local\/get-insights-into-history-and-future-of-istio-content\/). This book provides detailed information on:\n\n- The rise of service mesh technology is due to the popularity of Kubernetes, microservices, DevOps, and cloud native architectures.\n- The emergence of Kubernetes and programmable proxies, which laid a solid foundation for Istio.\n- How eBPF can accelerate transparent traffic hijacking in Istio, but cannot replace the sidecar in the service mesh.\n- How the future of Istio lies in building a zero trust network based on the hybrid cloud.\n\nIn addition, there are also numerous illustrations in the book that will help you understand. With the entry of Istio into CNCF and the introduction of the latest Ambient Mesh, we can expect that Istio will be even easier to adopt, and continue to grow in features, capabilities, and community.\n\n---\n\n*This blog was originally published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/the-future-of-istio-the-path-to-zero-trust-security\/).*\n', '\/en\/blog\/the-future-of-istio\/')">

The main points of view in this article are as follows:\n\n- Due to the popularity of Kubernetes, microservices, DevOps, and cloud-native architectures, the rise of service mesh technology.\n- The rise of Kubernetes and programmable proxies has laid the technical groundwork for Istio\u0027s implementation.\n- While eBPF can accelerate transparent traffic hijacking in Istio, it can not replace sidecars in service meshes.\n- The future of Istio is to build a zero-trust network.\n\nNext, we start this article with the background of the birth of Istio.\n\n## The eve of the birth of Istio\n\nSince 2013, with the explosion of the mobile Internet, enterprises have had higher requirements for the efficiency of application iteration. Application architecture has begun to shift from monolithic to microservices, and DevOps has also become popular. In the same year, with the open source of Docker, the problems of application encapsulation and isolation were solved, making it easier to schedule applications in the orchestration system. In 2014, Kubernetes and Spring Boot were open-sourced, and Spring framework development of microservice applications became popular. In the next few years, a large number of RPC middleware open source projects appeared, such as Google released gRPC 1.0 in 2016. The service framework is in full bloom. In order to save costs, increase development efficiency, and make applications more flexible, more and more enterprises are migrating to the cloud, but this is not just as simple as moving applications to the cloud. In order to use cloud computing more efficiently, a set of \u0022cloud native\u0022 methods and concepts are also on the horizon.\n\n## Istio Open Source Timeline\n\nLet\u0027s briefly review the major events of Istio open source:\n\n- **September 2016**: Since Envoy is an important part of Istio, Istio\u0027s open source timeline should have an Envoy part. At first, Envoy was only used as an edge proxy inside Lyft, and it was verified in large-scale production inside Lyft before Envoy was open sourced. In fact, Envoy was open sourced before it was open sourced, and it got the attention of Google engineers. At that time, Google was planning to launch an open source project of service mesh, and initially planned to use Nginx as a proxy. In 2017, Envoy donated to [CNCF](https:\/\/cncf.io\/).\n- **May 2017**: Istio was announced as open source by Google, IBM, and Lyft. The microservices architecture was used from the beginning. The composition of the data plane, control plane, and sidecar pattern were determined.\n- **March 2018**: Kubernetes successfully became the first project to graduate from CNCF, becoming more and more \u0022boring\u0022. The basic API has been finalized. In the second edition, CNCF officially wrote the service mesh into the cloud native first definition. The company I currently work for, [Tetrate](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/), was founded by the Google Istio team.\n- **July 2018**: Istio 1.0 is released, billed as \u0022production ready\u0022.\n- **March 2020**: Istio 1.5 was released, the architecture returned to a monolithic application, the release cycle was determined, a major version was released every three months, and the API became stable.\n- **From 2020 to the present**: The development of Istio mainly focuses on Day 2 operation, performance optimization, and extensibility. Several open source projects in the Istio ecosystem have begun to emerge, such as [Slime](https:\/\/github.com\/slime-io\/slime\/), [Areaki](https:\/\/github.com\/aeraki-mesh\/aeraki), and [Merbridge](https:\/\/github.com\/merbridge\/merbridge).\n\n## Why did Istio come after Kubernetes?\n\nThe emergence mentioned here refers to the birth of the concept of \u0022service mesh\u0022. After microservices and containerization, the increase in the use of heterogeneous languages, the surge in the number of services, and the shortened life cycle of containers are the fundamental reasons for the emergence of service meshes.\n\nTo make it possible for developers to manage traffic between services with minimal cost, Istio needs to solve three problems:\n\n1. Transparent traffic hijacks traffic between applications, which means that developers can quickly use the capabilities brought by Istio without modifying applications.\n1. Another point is the operation and maintenance level; how to inject the proxy into each application and manage these distributed sidecar proxies efficiently.\n1. An efficient and scalable sidecar proxy that can be configured through an API.\n\nThe above three conditions are indispensable for the Istio service mesh, and we can see from them that these requirements are basically the requirements for the sidecar proxy. The choice of this proxy will directly affect the direction and success of the project.\n\nIn order to solve the three problems above, Istio chose:\n\n1. Container Orchestration and Scheduling Platform: Kubernetes\n1. Programable proxy: Envoy\n\nFrom the figure below, we can see the transition of the service deployment architecture from Kubernetes to Istio, with many changes and constants.\n\n![Schematic diagram of the architectural change from Kubernetes to Istio](kubernetes-to-istio.svg)\n\nFrom Kubernetes to Istio, in a nutshell, the deployment architecture of the application has the following characteristics:\n\n- Kubernetes manages the life cycle of applications, specifically, application deployment and management (scaling, automatic recovery, and release).\n- Automatic sidecar injection based on Kubernetes to achieve transparent traffic interception. First, the inter-service traffic is intercepted through the sidecar proxy, and then the behavior of the microservice is managed through the control plane configuration. Nowadays, the deployment mode of service mesh has also ushered in new challenges. A sidecar is no longer necessary for Istio service mesh. The proxyless service mesh based on gRPC is also being tested.\n- The service mesh decouples traffic management from Kubernetes, and the traffic inside the service mesh does not need the support of the kube-proxy component. Through the abstraction close to the microservice application layer, the traffic between services is managed to achieve security and observability functions.\n- The control plane issues proxy configuration to the data plane through the xDS protocol. The proxies that have implemented xDS include [Envoy](https:\/\/envoyproxy.io\/) and the open source [MOSN](https:\/\/mosn.io\/).\n- When a client outside the Kubernetes cluster accesses the internal services of the cluster, it was originally through Kubernetes Ingress, but after Istio is available, it will be accessed through Gateway.\n\n### Transparent traffic hijacking\n\nIf you are using middleware such as gRPC to develop microservices, after integrating the SDK into the program, the interceptor in the SDK will automatically intercept the traffic for you, as shown in the following figure.\n\n![Interceptor diagram of gRPC](grpc.svg)\n\nHow to make the traffic in the Kubernetes pod go through the proxy? The answer is to inject a proxy into each application pod, share the network space with the application, and then modify the traffic path within the pod so that all traffic in and out of the pod goes through the sidecar. Its architecture is shown in the figure below.\n\n![Diagram of transparent traffic hijacking in Istio](istio-route-iptables.svg)\n\nFrom the figure, we can see that there is a very complex set of iptables traffic hijacking logic. The advantage of using iptables is that it is applicable to any Linux operating system. But this also has some side effects:\n\n1. All services in the Istio mesh need to add a network hop when entering and leaving the pod. Although each hop may only be two or three milliseconds, as the dependencies between services and services in the mesh increase, this latency may increase significantly, which may not be suitable for service meshes for services that pursue low latency.\n1. Because Istio injects a large number of sidecars into the data plane, especially when the number of services increases, the control plane needs to deliver more Envoy proxy configurations to the data plane, which will cause the data plane to occupy a lot of system memory and network resources.\n\nHow to optimize the service mesh in response to these two problems?\n\n1. Use proxyless mode: remove the sidecar proxy and go back to the SDK.\n1. Optimize the data plane: reduce the frequency and size of proxy configurations delivered to the data plane.\n1. eBPF: it can be used to optimize network hijacking.\n\nThis article will explain these details in the section on performance optimization later on.\n\n### Sidecar operation and maintenance management\n\nIstio is built on top of Kubernetes, which can leverage Kubernetes\u0027 container orchestration and lifecycle management to automatically inject sidecars into pods through admission controllers when Kubernetes creates pods. \n\nIn order to solve the resource consumption problem of Sidecar, some people have proposed four deployment modes for the service mesh, as shown in the following figure.\n\n![Schematic diagram of four deployment modes of service mesh](deployment-model.svg)\n\nThe following table compares these four deployment methods in detail. Each of them has advantages and disadvantages. The specific choice depends on the current situation.\n\n{{\u003ctable \u0022Comparison of four deployment modes of service mesh\u0022\u003e}}\n\n| **Mode**                                 | **Memory overhead**                                          | **Security**                                                 | **Fault domain**                                             | **Operation and maintenance**                                |\n| :--------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Sidecar proxy**                        | The overhead is greatest because a proxy is injected per pod. | Since the sidecar must be deployed with the workload, it is possible for the workload to bypass the sidecar. | Pod-level isolation, if the proxy fails, only the workload in the Pod is affected. | A workload\u0027s sidecar can be upgraded independently without affecting other workloads. |\n| **Node sharing proxy**                   | There is only one proxy on each node, shared by all workloads on that node, with low overhead. | There are security risks in the management of encrypted content and private keys. | Node-level isolation, if a version conflict, configuration conflict, or extension incompatibility occurs when a shared proxy is upgraded, it may affect all workloads on that node. | There is no need to worry about injecting sidecars.          |\n| **Service Account \/ Node Sharing Proxy** | All workloads under the service account\/identity use a shared proxy with little overhead. | Authentication and security of connections between workloads and proxy cannot be guaranteed. | The level isolation between nodes and service accounts, the fault is the same as \u0022node sharing proxy\u0022. | Same as \u0022node sharing proxy\u0022 mode.                           |\n| **Shared remote proxy with micro-proxy** | Because injecting a micro-proxy for each pod, the overhead is relatively large. | The micro-proxy handles mTLS exclusively and is not responsible for L7 routing, which can ensure security. | When a Layer 7 policy needs to be applied, the traffic of the workload instance is redirected to the L7 proxy, and can be bypassed directly if it is not needed.

I will quote some of his views below to illustrate the key role of programmable proxies in Istio.\n\nThe following figure shows the evolution process of the proxy software from configuration to programmable mode, and the representative proxy software in each stage.\n\n![Schematic diagram of the evolution of proxy software](proxy-evolution.svg)\n\nThe entire proxy evolution process is as the application moves from local and monolithic to large-scale and distributed. Below, I will briefly outline the evolution of the proxy software:\n\n- **The era of configuration files**: almost all software has configuration files, and proxy software is more inseparable from configuration files because of its relatively complex functions. The proxy at this stage is mainly developed using the C language, including its extension module, which highlights the ability of the proxy itself. This is also the most primitive and basic form of our use of proxies, including Nginx, Apache HTTP Server, [Squid](http:\/\/www.squid-cache.org\/), etc.\n- **Configuration language era**: Proxies in this era are more extensible and flexible, such as dynamic data acquisition and matching logic judgment. Varnish and HAProxy are two examples of representative software.\n- **The era of scripting languages**: Since the introduction of scripting languages, proxy software has become programmable. We can use scripts to add dynamic logic to proxies more easily, increasing development efficiency. The representative software is Nginx and its supported scripting languages.\n- **The era of clusters**: With the popularity of cloud computing, large-scale deployment and dynamic configuration of APIs have become necessary capabilities for proxies, and with the increase in network traffic, large-scale proxy clusters have emerged as the times require. The representative proxy software of this era includes Envoy, Kong, etc.\n- **Cloud-native era**: Multi-tenancy, elasticity, heterogeneous hybrid cloud, multi-cluster, security, and observability are all higher requirements for proxies in the cloud-native era. This will also be a historical opportunity for service meshes, with representative software such as Istio, Linkerd, and [Pypi](https:\/\/flomesh.io\/).\n\n## Are these all service meshes?\n\nSo, is it possible to build a service mesh with proxies? Now I will list the existing service mesh projects, and let\u0027s explore the development law and nature of service mesh together. The table below compares the current popular open source \u0022service mesh\u0022 projects.\n\n{{\u003ctable \u0022Service mesh open source project comparison table\u0022\u003e}}\n\n| Contrast           | Istio                                                        | Linkerd                                                     | Consul Connect                                               | Traefik Mesh                                                 | Kuma                                | Open Service Mesh (OSM)                       |\n| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |\n| Current version   | 1.14                                                         | 2.11                                                        | 1.12                                                         | 1.4                                                          | 1.5                                 | 1.0l                                          |\n| License           | Apache License 2.0                                           | Apache License 2.0                                          | Mozilla License                                              | Apache License 2.0                                           | Apache License 2.0                  | Apache License 2.0                            |\n| Initiator          | Google, IBM, Lyft                                            | Buoyant                                                     | HashiCorp                                                    | Traefik Labs                                                 | Kong                                | Microsoft                                     |\n| Service proxy | Envoy, which supports proxyless mode for gRPC                | [Linkerd2-proxy](https:\/\/github.com\/linkerd\/linkerd2-proxy) | Default is [Envoy](https:\/\/www.envoyproxy.io\/) , replaceable | [Traefik Proxy](https:\/\/traefik.io\/traefik\/)                 | [Envoy](https:\/\/www.envoyproxy.io\/) | [Envoy](https:\/\/www.envoyproxy.io\/)           |\n| Ingress controller | Envoy, custom Ingress, supports Kubernetes Gateway API       | no built-in                                                 | Envoy, with support for the Kubernetes Gateway API           | no built-in                                                  | Kong                                | Support Contour, Nginx, compatible with other |\n| Governance         | Istio Community and Open Usage Commons, proposed to donate to CNCF | CNCF                                                        | View [Contribution Guidelines](https:\/\/github.com\/hashicorp\/consul\/blob\/master\/.github\/CONTRIBUTING.md) | View [Contribution Guidelines](https:\/\/github.com\/traefik\/mesh\/blob\/master\/CONTRIBUTING.md) | CNCF                                | CNCF                                          |\n| Comment | It is one of the most popular service mesh projects at present. | The earliest service mesh, the creator of the concept of \u0022Service Mesh\u0022, the first service mesh project to enter CNCF, using a lightweight proxy developed with Rust. | Consul service mesh, using Envoy as a sidecar proxy. | A service mesh project launched by Traefik, using Traefik Proxy as a sidecar and supporting SMI (mentioned below). | A service mesh project launched by Kong that uses Envoy as a sidecar proxy, using Kong\u0027s own gateway as ingress. | An open source service mesh created by Microsoft, using Envoy as a sidecar, compatible with SMI (also proposed by Microsoft). |\n\n{{\u003c \/table \u003e}}\n\nThe open source projects in the above table are summarized below, and several projects closely related to service mesh are added, as follows:\n\n- [Envoy](https:\/\/envoyproxy.io\/): Envoy is a cloud-native proxy, frequently used as a sidecar in other Envoy-based service meshes and for building API Gateways.\n- [Service Mesh Performance (SMP)](https:\/\/smp-spec.io\/): Metrics that capture details of infrastructure capacity, service mesh configuration, and workload metadata to standardize service mesh values and describe the performance of any deployment.\n- [Service Mesh Interface (SMI)](https:\/\/smi-spec.io\/): It is not a service mesh, but a set of service mesh implementation standards. Similar to OAM, SPIFFE, CNI, CSI, etc., it defines interface standards, and the specific implementation varies. Currently, Traefik Mesh and Open Service Mesh claim to support this specification.\n- [Network Service Mesh](https:\/\/networkservicemesh.io\/): It\u0027s worth mentioning this project because it\u0027s often mistaken for a service mesh. In fact, it is oriented towards a three-layer network, and it can be used to connect multi-cloud\/hybrid clouds without changing the CNI plug-in. It\u0027s not a \u0022service mesh\u0022 as we define it, but a powerful complement to a service mesh (albeit a somewhat confusing name with a service mesh in it).\n\nLooking at the so-called \u0022service mesh\u0022 projects mentioned above, we can see that most service mesh project initiators start out as proxies, and then do the control plane. And Istio, Consul Connect, Open Service Mesh, and Kuma all use Envoy as a sidecar proxy. Only Linkerd and Traefik Mesh have launched their own proxies. And all service mesh projects support the sidecar pattern. Apart from Istio, Linkerd, and Consul Connect, which have been used in production, other service mesh projects are currently only \u0022toys\u0022.\n\n## Performance optimization for Istio\n\nAfter Istio 1.5 had a stable architecture, the community\u0027s main focus was on optimizing Istio\u0027s performance. Below, I will give you a detailed introduction to performance optimization methods in Istio, including:\n\n- Use the Proxyless mode.\n- Use eBPF to optimize traffic hijacking.\n- Optimization of control plane performance.\n- Optimization of data plane performance.\n\n### Proxyless mode\n\nProxyless mode is an experimental feature proposed by Istio in version 1.11-a service mesh without sidecar proxy based on gRPC and Istio. Using this pattern allows you to add gRPC services directly to Istio without injecting an Envoy proxy into the Pod. The figure below shows a comparison of sidecar mode and proxyless mode.\n\n![Sidecar vs Proxyless](sidecar-to-proxyless.svg)\n\nAs we can see from the above figure, although proxyless mode does not use a proxy for data plane communication, it still needs an agent for initialization and communication with the control plane. First, the agent generates a bootstrap file at startup, in the same way that it generates bootstrap files for Envoy. This tells the gRPC library how to connect to Istiod, where to find certificates for data plane communication, and what metadata to send to the control plane. Next, the agent acts as an xDS proxy, connecting and authenticating with \u0060Istiod\u0060. Finally, the agent obtains and rotates the certificate used in the data plane communication.\n\n\u003e *The essence of a service mesh is not a sidecar model, nor a configuration center, or transparent traffic interception, but a standardized inter-service communication standard.*\n\nSome people say that the proxyless model has returned to the old way of developing microservices based on SDK, and the advantages of service meshes have been lost. Can it still be called service mesh? In fact, this is also a compromise on performance—if you mainly use gRPC to develop microservices, you only need to maintain gRPC versions in different languages; that is, you can manage microservices through the control plane.\n\n\u003e *Envoy xDS has become the de facto standard for communication between cloud-native application services.*\n\n### Optimizing traffic hijacking with eBPF\n\nIn the section on transparent traffic hijacking, we can see the iptables rules and paths that an inter-service traffic passes through when it reaches the destination pod, which needs to go through multiple iptables rules, such as \u0060PREROUTING\u0060, \u0060ISTIO_INBOUND\u0060, \u0060ISTIO_IN_REDIRECT\u0060, \u0060OUTPUT\u0060, \u0060ISTIO_OUTPUT\u0060, and so on. Suppose now that there is a service A that wants to call service B in another pod on a non-localhost through the network stack, as shown in the figure below.\n\n![Service request path between pods not on the same host (iptables mode)](iptables-process.svg)\n\nFrom the figure, we can see that there are four iptables passes in the whole calling process. Among them, the outbound (iptables2) from Envoy in Pod A and the inbound (iptables3) from eth0 in Pod B are unavoidable. So can the remaining two, iptables1 and iptables4 be optimized? Wouldn\u0027t it be possible to shorten the network path by letting the two sockets communicate directly? This requires programming through eBPF such that:\n\n- Service A\u0027s traffic is sent directly to Envoy\u0027s inbound socket.\n- After Envoy in Pod B receives the inbound traffic, it has determined that the traffic is to be sent to the local service and directly connects the outbound socket to Service B.\n\nThe transparent traffic interception network path using eBPF mode is shown in the following figure.\n\n![Service request path between pods not on the same host (eBPF mode)](ebpf-diff-node.svg)\n\nIf service A and service B to be accessed are on the same node, the network path will be shorter.\n\n![Network request path between the same host Pod (eBPF mode)](ebpf-same-node.svg)\n\nAccess between services in the same node completely bypasses the TCP\/IP stack and becomes direct access between sockets.\n\n{{\u003ccallout note \u0022What is eBPF?\u0022\u003e}}\n\nWe know that modifying the Linux kernel code is difficult, and it takes a long time for new features to be released into the kernel. eBPF is a framework that allows users to load and run custom programs within the operating system\u0027s kernel. That is, with eBPF, you can extend and change the behavior of the kernel without directly modifying the kernel. I will briefly introduce eBPF to you below.\n\n- After the eBPF program is loaded into the kernel, it needs to pass the verification of the verifier before it can run. The verifier can prevent the eBPF program from accessing beyond its authority, ensuring the kernel\u0027s security.\n- eBPF programs are attached to kernel events and are triggered when there is an entry or exit from a kernel function.\n- In kernel space, eBPF programs must be written in a language that supports a compiler that generates eBPF byte code. Currently, you can write eBPF programs in C and Rust.\n- The eBPF program has compatibility issues with different Linux versions.\n\nSince the eBPF program can directly monitor and operate the Linux kernel, it has a perspective on the lowest level of the system and can play a role in traffic management, observability, and security.\n\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\nThe open source project [Merbridge](https:\/\/github.com\/merbridge\/merbridge) uses eBPF to shorten the path of transparent traffic hijacking and optimize the performance of the service mesh. For some details on the Merbridge implementation, please refer to the [Istio blog](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2022\/merbridge\/) .\n\n{{\u003ccallout warning Notice\u003e}}\nThe eBPF functions used by Merbridge require a Linux kernel version ≥ 5.7.\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\nAt first glance, eBPF seems to implement the functions of Istio at a lower level and has a greater tendency to replace sidecar. But eBPF also has many limitations that make it impossible to replace service meshes and sidecars in the foreseeable future. Removing the sidecar in favor of a proxy-per-host model would result in:\n\n1. The explosion radius of a proxy failure is expanded to the entire node.\n2. It makes the security problem more complicated because too many certificates are stored on a node. Once attacked, there will be a risk of key leakage.\n3. On the host, traffic contention between Pods.\n\nMoreover, eBPF is mainly responsible for Layer 3\/4 traffic and can run together with CNI, but it is not suitable to use eBPF for Layer 7 traffic.\n\n\u003e *In the near future, eBPF technology will not be able to replace service meshes and sidecars.*\n\n### Control plane performance optimization\n\nThe above two optimizations are carried out for the data plane. Let\u0027s look at the performance optimization of the control plane. You can think of a service mesh as a show, where the control plane is the director and the data plane is all the actors. The director is not involved in the show but directs the actors. If the plot of the show is simple and the duration is very short, then each actor will be allocated very few scenes, and rehearsal will be very easy; if it is a large-scale show, the number of actors is large and the plot is very complicated. To rehearse the show well, one director may not be enough. He can\u0027t direct so many actors, so we need multiple assistant directors (expanding the number of control plane instances); we also need to prepare lines and scripts for actors, if actors It is also possible to perform a series of lines and scenes in one shot (reduce the interruption of the data plane and push updates in batches), so is our rehearsal more efficient?\n\nFrom the above analogy, you should be able to find the direction of control plane performance optimization, that is:\n\n- Reduce the size of the configuration that needs to be pushed.\n- Push batch proxy.\n- To expand the scale of the control plane.\n\n#### Reduce the configuration that needs to be pushed out\n\nThe easiest and most straightforward way to optimize control plane performance is to reduce the size of the configuration to be pushed. Assuming that there is workload A, if the proxy configuration related to A, that is, the configuration of the service that A needs to access, is pushed to A, instead of pushing the configuration of all services in the mesh to A, it can greatly reduce the number of services to be pushed. The size and application range of the configuration. The Sidecar resource in Istio can help us do this. The following is an example of a sidecar configuration:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: networking.istio.io\/v1alpha3\nkind: Sidecar\nmetadata:\n  name: default\n  namespace: us-west-1\nspec:\n  workloadSelector:\n    labels:\n      app: app-a\n  egress:\n  - hosts:\n    - \u0022us-west-1\/*\u0022\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nWe can use the \u0060workloadSelector\u0060 field  to limit the scope of workloads that the sidecar configuration applies to, and the \u0060egress\u0060 field is used to determine the scope of services for the workload, so that the control plane can only push the configuration of its dependent services to service A, greatly reducing the need to push to the data plane. The configuration size of the service mesh reduces the memory and network consumption of the service mesh.\n\n#### Batch push the proxy configurations\n\nThe process of pushing the proxy configuration from the control plane Istiod to the data plane is complex. The following figure shows the process.\n\n![Flowchart of Istiod pushing proxy configuration to the data plane](istiod-push.svg)\n\nAfter an administrator configures the Istio mesh, the process for pushing proxy configuration in Istiod is as follows:\n\n1. The event that the administrator updates the configuration will trigger the configuration synchronization of the data plane.\n1. After listening to these events, Istio\u0027s \u0060DiscoveryServer\u0060 components will not push the configuration to the data plane immediately, but will add these events to the queue and continue to merge events within a period of time. This process is called debouncing, which is to prevent frequent updates to the data plane configuration.\n1. After the debouncing period, these events will be pushed to the queue.\n1. To expedite push progress, Istiod will limit the number of simultaneous push requests.\n1. Envoy configuration push data plane workloads are translated into events.\n\nFrom the above process, we can see that the key to optimizing configuration push is the debounce period in step 2 and the current limit setting in step 4. There are several environmental variables that can help you set up control plane push:\n\n- \u0060PILOT_DEBOUNCE_AFTER\u0060: The time after which the event will be added to the push queue.\n- \u0060PILOT_DEBOUNCE_MAX\u0060: This defines the maximum amount of time an event can debounce.\n- \u0060PILOT_ENABLE_EDS_DEBOUNCE\u0060: Specifies whether endpoint updates meet debounce rules or have priority and fall into the push queue immediately.\n- \u0060PILOT_PUSH_THROTTLE\u0060: Controls how many push requests are processed at once.\n\nPlease refer to the [Istio documentation](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/reference\/commands\/pilot-agent\/#envvars) for the default values and specific configuration of these environment variables .\n\nHow to set these values can follow the following principles:\n\n- If control plane resources are idle, to speed up the propagation of configuration updates, you can:\n  - Shorten the debounce period and increase the number of pushes.\n  - Increase the number of push requests processed simultaneously.\n- If the control plane is saturated, to reduce performance bottlenecks, you can:\n  - Delay the debounce cycle to reduce the number of pushes.\n  - Increase the number of push requests processed simultaneously.\n\nAs for how to set the optimal solution, you need to debug it in conjunction with your observable system.\n\n#### Scale up the control plane\n\nIf setting up debounce batch processing and sidecar cannot optimize the performance of the control plane, the final choice is to expand the scale of the control plane, including expanding the resources of a single Istiod instance and increasing the number of Istiod instances. Which expansion method is used depends on the situation:\n\n- When the resource occupancy of a single Istiod is saturated, it is recommended that you increase the instance size of Istiod. This is usually because there are too many resources in the service mesh (Istio\u0027s custom resources, such as VirtualService, DestinationRule, etc.) that need to be processed.\n- Then increase the number of instances of Istiod, which can spread the workloads to be managed by each instance.\n\n### Data plane performance optimization\n\nApache SkyWalking can serve as an observability tool for Istio and can also help us analyze the performance of services in dynamic debugging and troubleshooting. Its newly launched Apache SkyWalking Rover component can use eBPF technology to accurately locate Istio\u0027s key performance issues.\n\nOn the data plane, we can increase Envoy\u0027s throughput to optimize Istio\u0027s performance by:\n\n- Disable Zipkin tracing or reduce the sample rate.\n- Simplified access log format.\n- Disable Envoy\u0027s Access Log Service (ALS).\n\nFor data on the impact of the above optimizations on Envoy throughput, see Using eBPF to pinpoint key performance issues for service meshes.\n\n## Envoy: the service mesh\u0027s leading actor\n\nWe know that the service mesh is composed of the data plane and the control plane. From the above list of service mesh open source projects, we can see that most of the service mesh open source projects are based on Envoy, and then develop their own control plane. Remember when I likened a service mesh to a gig earlier in this article? In this service mesh performance, there is no way to think that Envoy is the leading actor. The xDS protocol, invented by Envoy, has basically become a general API for service meshes. Many open source projects for service meshes use Envoy as the data plane. Shown below is the architecture diagram of Envoy.\n\n![Envoy Architecture Diagram](envoy-arch.svg)\n\nxDS is the core that differentiates Envoy from other proxies because its code and parsing process are very complex and it is difficult to expand. The following is a topology diagram of Istio components. From the figure, we can see that there is not only one \u0060envoy\u0060 process but a \u0060pilot-agent\u0060.\n\n{{\u003cfigure title=\u0022Istio component topology\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 id=\u0022istio-components\u0022 src=\u0022istio-components.svg\u0022\u003e}}\n\nThe role of the \u0060pilot-agent\u0060 process is as follows:\n\n- As \u0060the\u0060 parent process of, responsible for the lifecycle management of Envoy.\n- Receive pushes from the control plane, configure the proxy and certificates.\n- Collect Envoy statistics and aggregate sidecar statistics for Prometheus to collect.\n- A built-in local DNS proxy is used to resolve the internal domain name of the cluster that cannot be resolved by Kubernetes DNS.\n- Health checks for Envoy and DNS proxy.\n\nFrom the above functions, we can see that the \u0060pilot-agent\u0060 process is mainly used to interact with Istiod and play a commanding and auxiliary role for Envoy. The core component of Istio is Envoy. So will Envoy \u0022act and guide,\u0022 no longer cooperate with Istio, and build its own control plane?\n\n\u003e *In a Sidecar container, the \u0060pilot-agent\u0060 is like Envoy\u0027s \u0022Sidecar\u0022.*\n\n{{\u003ccallout note \u0022Readers to think about\u0022\u003e}}\nCan the \u0060pilot-agent\u0060 function be built directly into Envoy, thus eliminating the \u0060pilot-agent\u0060?\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\n## Envoy Gateway unified service mesh gateway\n\nIn Kubernetes, the first resource object used to expose services in a cluster, in addition to the service resource object, is Ingress. Using Ingress you simply open an external access point for the cluster, routing traffic to specific services via HTTP Hosts and \u0060path\u0060. Compared with exposing services directly to service resources , it can reduce the network access point (PEP) of the cluster and reduce the risk of the cluster being attacked by the network. The following figure shows the process of using Ingress to access services in the cluster.\n\n![Kubernetes Ingress traffic access flow chart](ingress.svg)\n\nBefore Kubernetes, API Gateway software was widely used as edge routing. When referring to Istio, Istio\u0027s custom Gateway resources are added, which makes accessing resources in the Istio service mesh one more option, as shown in the following figure.\n\n![Ways to access services in the Istio mesh](access-cluster.svg)\n\nNow, to expose services in a single Istio mesh, how do I choose between \u0060NodePort\u0060, \u0060LoadBalancer\u0060, Istio Gateway, Kubernetes Ingress, and API Gateway software? If it is a multi-cluster service mesh, how do clients access services within the mesh? Our service mesh lead, Envoy, has done this well and is used in many forms:\n\n- Istio, Kuma, and Consul Connect all use Envoy as a sidecar proxy.\n- Kubernetes Ingress Controller\/API Gateway: [Contour](https:\/\/github.com\/projectcontour\/contour), [Emissary](https:\/\/github.com\/emissary-ingress\/emissary), [Hango](https:\/\/github.com\/hango-io\/hango-gateway), [Gloo](https:\/\/github.com\/solo-io\/gloo).\n\nThese projects utilize Envoy to implement service meshes and API gateways, with a lot of functional overlap, proprietary features, or a lack of community diversity due to the fact that the Envoy community does not provide a control plane implementation. In order to change the status quo, the Envoy community initiated the Envoy Gateway project, which will not change the Envoy core proxy, xDS, and go-control-plane. The project aims to combine the experience of existing Envoy-based API Gateway related projects. Some Envoy-specific extensions to the Kubernetes Gateway API lower the barrier to entry for Envoy users to use gateways. Because the Envoy Gateway still issues configuration to the Envoy proxy through xDS, you can also use it to manage gateways that support xDS, such as the Istio Gateway.\n\nThe gateways we have seen now are basically used as ingress gateways in a single cluster and can do nothing for multi-cluster and multi-mesh. To cope with multiple clusters, we need to add another layer of gateways on top of Istio and a global control plane to route traffic between multiple clusters, as shown in the figure below.\n\n![Schematic diagram of two-level gateway with multi-cluster and multi-mesh](t2-gateway.svg)\n\n{{\u003ccallout note \u0022A brief introduction to two-tire gateways\u0022\u003e}}\n- The Tire-1 gateway (hereinafter referred to as T1) is located at the application edge and is used in a multi-cluster environment. The same application is hosted on different clusters at the same time, and the T1 gateway routes the application\u0027s request traffic between these clusters.\n- The Tire-2 gateway (hereafter referred to as T2) is located at the edge of a cluster and is used to route traffic to services within that cluster managed by the service mesh.\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\nMulti-cluster service mesh management is achieved by adding a layer of global control plane and APIs in addition to the Istio control plane. Deploying T1 gateways as a cluster prevents a single point of failure. To learn more about two-tier gateways, refer [to Routing Service Mesh Traffic Through Two-Tier Gateway Designs](https:\/\/cloudnative.to\/blog\/designing-traffic-flow-via-tier1-and-tier2-ingress-gateways\/) .\n\nThe configuration of the T1 gateway is as follows:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: gateway.tsb.tetrate.io\/v2\nkind: Tier1Gateway\nmetadata:\n  name: service1-tier1\n  group: demo-gw-group\n  organization: demo-org\n  tenant: demo-tenant\n  workspace: demo-ws\nspec:\n  workloadSelector:\n    namespace: t1\n    labels:\n      app: gateway-t1\n      istio: ingressgateway\n  externalServers:\n  - name: service1\n    hostname: servicea.example.com\n    port: 80\n    tls: {}\n    clusters:\n    - name: cluster1\n      weight: 75\n    - name: cluster2\n      weight: 25 \n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThis configuration exposes \u0060servicea.example.com\u0060  service through the T1 gateway and forwards \u006075%\u0060 of the traffic accessing the service to cluster1 and \u006025%\u0060 of the traffic to cluster2. In addition, in order to deal with the traffic, services, and security configurations in multiple clusters, Tetrate\u0027s flagship product, [Tetrate Service Bridge](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/tetrate-service-bridge\/), a series of group APIs have also been added to the TSB documentation for details.\n\n## Istio open source ecosystem\n\nIstio has been open source for more than five years, and many open source projects have emerged in the past two years, among which the more representative ones are:\n\n- Slime (NetEase open source)\n- Tencent\u0027s open source initiatives Aeraki\n- Istio\u0027s official support for Wasm plugins\n\nTheir presence makes Istio more intelligent and expands the scope of Istio.\n\n### Slime\n\nSlime is an Istio-based smart mesh manager open-sourced by the NetEase Shufan microservices team. Slime has been implemented based on Kubernetes Operator and can be used as the CRD manager of Istio. It can define dynamic service governance policies without any customization of Istio, so as to achieve the purpose of automatically and conveniently using the high-level functions of Istio and Envoy.\n\nIn the previous control plane performance optimization, we mentioned optimizing the performance of Istio by \u0022reducing the configuration that needs to be pushed\u0022, but Istio cannot automatically identify and cannot rely on the proxy configuration that needs to be pushed to each sidecar to optimize. Slime provides a  \u0060lazyload\u0060 controller, which can help us implement lazy loading of configuration. Users do not need to configure the \u0060SidecarScope\u0060 manually. Istio can load service configuration and service discovery information on demand.\n\nThe following figure shows the flow chart of updating the data plane configuration with Slime as the management plane of Istio.\n\n![Flowchart for updating Istio data plane configuration using Slime](slime-process.svg)\n\nThe specific steps for updating the data plane configuration are as follows:\n\n1. The Slime Operator completes the initialization of Slime components in Kubernetes according to the administrator\u0027s configuration.\n2. Developers create configurations that conform to the Slime CRD specification and apply them to the Kubernetes cluster.\n3. Slime queries the monitoring data of related services saved in Prometheus, converts Slime CRD to Istio CRD in combination with the configuration of the adaptive part in Slime CRD, and pushes it to Global Proxy at the same time.\n4. Istio monitors the creation of Istio CRDs.\n5. Istio sends the Sidecar Proxy\u0027s configuration information to the corresponding Sidecar Proxy on the data plane.\n\nBecause the first invocation of all services in the data plane passes through the Global Proxy, the Proxy can record the invocation and dependency information of all services, and update the configuration of the Sidecar resource in Istio according to the dependency information. When the routing information is redefined, the original record of the Global Proxy becomes invalid, and a new data structure is required to maintain the calling relationship of the service. Slime created a  \u0060ServiceFence\u0060 to maintain the service invocation relationship and solve the problem of missing service information.\n\n### Aeraki\n\nAeraki Mesh is a service mesh project open sourced by Tencent Cloud in March 2021. It expands support for seven-layer protocols based on Istio and focuses on solving the service governance of **non-HTTP protocols** in Istio.  It entered the CNCF sandbox in June 2022.\n\nThe following figure shows the architectural diagram of Aeraki.\n\n![Aeraki Architecture Diagram](aeraki-arch.svg)\n\nThe process of using Aeraki to serve non-HTTP into an Istio mesh is as follows:\n\n1. Aeraki\u0027s X2Istio component connects to the service registry, obtains the registration information of non-HTTP services, and generates a ServiceEntry to register with Istio.\n2. Aeraki, as the management plane on top of Istio, obtains the ServiceEntry configuration from Istio.\n3. Aeraki judges the protocol type of the service (e.g. \u0060tcp-metaprotocol-dubbo\u0060) through the port command, then generates the MetaProtocol Proxy Filter (compatible with EnvoyFilter) configuration, and at the same time modifies the RDS address to point it to Aeraki.\n4. Istio uses the xDS protocol to deliver the configuration (LDS, CDS, EDS, etc.) to the data plane.\n5. Aeraki generates routing rules based on the information in the service registry and user settings and sends them to the data plane through RDS.\n\nThe key to the whole process of accessing non-HTTP services in Istio is the **MetaProtocol Proxy**. Istio supports HTTP\/HTTP2, TCP and gRPC protocols by default, and experimentally supports Mongo, MySQL and Redis protocols. To use Istio to route traffic for other protocols not only requires a lot of work to modify the Istio control plane and extend Envoy, but also a lot of duplication because different protocols share common control logic. The Envoy MetaProtocol Proxy is a general seven-layer protocol proxy implemented based on Envoy. The MetaProtocol Proxy is an extension based on the Envoy code. It implements basic capabilities such as service discovery, load balancing, RDS dynamic routing, traffic mirroring, fault injection, local\/global traffic limiting, etc. for the seven-layer protocol, which greatly reduces the difficulty of third-party protocol development for Envoy.\n\nThe following figure shows the architecture diagram of MetaProtocol Proxy.\n\n![MetaProtocol Proxy Architecture Diagram](metaprotocol-proxy.svg)\n\nWhen we want to extend Istio to support other seven-layer protocols such as Kafka, Dubbo, and Thrift, we only need to implement the codec interfaces (Decode and Encode) in the above figure, and then we can quickly develop a third-party protocol plug-in based on MetaProtocol. Because MetaProtocol Proxy is an extension of Envoy, you can still develop filters for it in different languages and use \u0060EnvoyFilter\u0060 resources to deliver configuration to the data plane.\n\n### WasmPlugin API\n\nWasmPlugin is an API introduced in Istio 1.12. As a proxy extension mechanism, we can use it to add custom and third-party Wasm modules to the data plane. The diagram below shows how a user can use the WasmPlugin in Istio.\n\n![Flowchart of using WasmPlugin in Istio](wasmplugin.svg)\n\nSpecific steps are as follows:\n\n1. Users use the Proxy-Wasm SDK (currently available in AssemblyScript, C\u002b\u002b, Rust, Zig, and Go) to develop extensions and build them into OCI images (such as Docker images) to upload to the mirror repository.\n2. The user writes the \u0060WasmPlugin\u0060 configuration and applies it to Istio.\n3. The \u0060WasmPlugin\u0060 configuration for the workload in the configuration is selected by the Istio control plane, and the Wasm module is injected into the specified Pod.\n4. The \u0060pilot-agent\u0060 in the sidecar loads the Wasm modules from remote or local files and run them in Envoy.\n\n## Who should use Istio?\n\nWell, having said that, what does this have to do with you? Istio\u0027s relationship with you depends on your role.\n\n- If you are the platform leader, after applying the service mesh, you may enhance the observability of your platform and have a unified platform to manage microservices. You will be the direct beneficiary and the main implementer of the service mesh.\n- If you are an application developer, you will also benefit from a service mesh because you can be more dedicated to the business logic and not worry about other non-functional issues such as retry policies, TLS, etc..\n\nThe following diagram shows the adoption path for service meshes.\n\n![The path to adopt service mesh](adopt.svg)\n\nWhether to adopt a service mesh depends on your technology development stage, whether the application implements containerization and microservices, the need for multi-language, whether mTLS is required, and the acceptance of performance loss.\n\n## Service mesh positioning in the cloud native technology stack\n\nThe development of technology is changing with each passing day. In the past two years, some new technologies have appeared, which seem to challenge the status of the service mesh. Some people claim that it can directly replace the existing service mesh of the classic sidecar model. We should not be confused by the noise of the outside world, correcting the positioning of service mesh in the cloud native technology stack.\n\n\u003e *Blindly promoting a technology and ignoring its applicable scenarios is hooliganism.*\n\nThe diagram below shows the cloud-native technology stack.\n\n![Cloud native technology stack diagram](cloud-native-stack.svg)\n\nWe can see that the \u0022cloud infrastructure\u0022, \u0022middleware\u0022, and \u0022application\u0022 layers in the cloud native technology stack diagram all enumerate some iconic open source projects that build standards in their fields:\n\n- In the field of cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes unifies the standards for container orchestration and application life cycle management, and the Operator mode lays the standards for extending the Kubernetes API and third-party application access.\n- In the field of middleware, the service mesh assumes some or all of the responsibilities of the seven-layer network, observability, and security in the cloud native technology stack. It runs in the lower layer of the application and is almost imperceptible; Dapr (distributed application runtime) defines the capability model of cloud-native middleware. Developers can integrate Dapr\u0027s multi-language SDK into their applications and programs for the distributed capabilities provided by Dapr, without caring about the applications running on them. environment and docking back-end infrastructure. Because the Dapr runtime (Sidecar mode deployment, which contains various building blocks) is running in the same Pod as the application, it automatically connects us with the backend components;\n- In the application field, OAM aims to establish an application model standard, an application through components, characteristics, policies, and workflows.\n\nThe diagram below shows how Istio is positioned for seven-tier mesh management in a cloud-native deployment.\n\n![Istio is positioned in a seven-layer network in a cloud-native architecture](istio-role.svg)\n\n{{\u003ccallout note \u0022What is the relationship between Dapr and Istio?\u0022\u003e}}\n\nSimilarities between Istio and Dapr:\n\n- Both Istio and Dapr can use the sidecar mode deployment model.\n- Both belong to middleware and can also manage communication between services.\n\nDifferences between Istio and Dapr:\n\n- Different goals: Istio\u0027s goal is to build a zero-trust network and define inter-service communication standards, while Dapr\u0027s goal is to build a standard API for middleware capabilities.\n- Different architectures: Istio = Envoy \u002b transparent traffic hijacking \u002b control plane; Dapr = multilingual SDK \u002b standardized API \u002b distributed capability components.\n- However, the application of Istio is almost imperceptible to developers and mainly requires the implementation of the infrastructure operation and maintenance team, while the application of Dapr requires developers to independently choose to integrate the Dapr SDK.\n\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\n## The future of service mesh\n\nIn the above article, I introduced the development context and open source ecosystem of Istio. Next, I will introduce the future trends of Istio service mesh:\n- Zero trust network\n- Hybrid cloud\n\n\u003e *The future of service meshes lies in being the infrastructure for zero-trust networks and hybrid clouds.*\n\nThis is also the direction of Tetrate, the enterprise-level service mesh provider of the author\u0027s company. We are committed to building an application-aware network suitable for any environment and any load and providing a zero-trust hybrid cloud platform. Shown below is the architecture diagram of Tetrate\u0027s flagship product, Tetrate Service Bridge.\n\n![TSB Architecture Diagram](tsb.svg)\n\nTetrate was founded by the founders of the Istio project, and TSB is based on open source Istio, Envoy, and Apache SkyWalking. We also actively contributed to the upstream community and participated in the creation of the Envoy Gateway project to simplify the use of Envoy gateways (XCP in the figure above is a gateway built with Envoy).\n\n## Zero trust\n\nZero Trust is an important topic at IstioCon 2022. Istio is becoming an important part of zero trust, the most important of which is **identity-oriented control** rather than network-oriented control.\n\n{{\u003ccallout note \u0022What is Zero Trust?\u0022\u003e}}\n\nZero Trust is a security philosophy, not a best practice that all security teams follow. The concept of zero trust was proposed to bring a more secure network to the cloud-native world. Zero trust is a theoretical state where all consumers within a network not only have no authority but also have no awareness of the surrounding network. The main challenges of zero trust are the increasingly granular authorization and time limit for user authorization.\n\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\n### Authentication\n\nIstio 1.14 adds support for SPIRE. SPIRE (SPIFFE Runtime Environment, CNCF Incubation Project) is an implementation of SPIFFE (Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone, CNCF Incubation Project). In Kubernetes, we use ServiceAccount to provide identity information for workloads in Pods, and its core is based on Token (using Secret resource storage) to represent workload identity. A token is a resource in a Kubernetes cluster. How to unify the identities of multiple clusters and workloads running in non-Kubernetes environments (such as virtual machines)? That\u0027s what SPIFFE is trying to solve.\n\nThe purpose of SPIFFE is to establish an open and unified workload identity standard based on the concept of zero trust, which helps to establish a fully identifiable data center network with zero trust. The core of SPIFFE is to define a short-lived encrypted identity document—SVID (SPFFE Verifiable Identity Document)—through a simple API, which is used as an identity document (based on an X.509 certificate or JWT token) for workload authentication. SPIRE can automatically rotate SVID certificates and keys according to administrator-defined policies, dynamically provide workload identities, and Istio can dynamically consume these workload identities through SPIRE.\n\nThe Kubernetes-based SPIRE architecture diagram is shown below.\n\n![Architecture diagram of SPIRE deployed in Kubernetes](spire-with-kubernetes.svg)\n\nIstio originally used the Citadel service in Istiod to be responsible for certificate management in the service mesh, and issued the certificate to the data plane through the xDS (to be precise, SDS API) protocol. With SPIRE, the work of certificate management is handed over to SPIRE Server. SPIRE also supports the Envoy SDS API. After we enable SPIRE in Istio, the traffic entering the workload pod will be authenticated once after being transparently intercepted into the sidecar. The purpose of authentication is to compare the identity of the workload with the environment information it runs on (node, Pod\u0027s ServiceAccount and Namespace, etc.) to prevent identity forgery. Please refer to How to Integrate SPIRE in Istio to learn how to use SPIRE for authentication in Istio.\n\nWe can deploy SPIRE in Kubernetes using the Kubernetes Workload Registrar, which automatically registers the workload in Kubernetes for us and generates an SVID. The registration machine is a Server-Agent architecture, which deploys a SPIRE Agent on each node, and the Agent communicates with the workload through a shared UNIX Domain Socket. The following diagram shows the process of using SPIRE for authentication in Istio.\n\n![Schematic diagram of the SPIRE-based workload authentication process in Istio\u0022](workload-attestation.svg)\n\nThe steps to using SPIRE for workload authentication in Istio are as follows:\n\n1. To obtain the SIVD, the SPIRE Agent is referred to as pilot-agent via shared UDS.\n1. The SPIRE Agent asks Kubernetes (to be precise, the kubelet on the node) for load information.\n1. The kubelet returns the information queried from the API server to the workload validator.\n1. The validator compares the result returned by the kubelet with the identity information shared by the sidecar. If it is the same, it returns the correct SVID cache to the workload. If it is different, the authentication fails.\n\nPlease refer to the SPIRE documentation for the detailed process of registering and authenticating workloads.\n\n### NGAC\n\nWhen each workload has an accurate identity, how can the permissions of these identities be restricted? RBAC is used by default in Kubernetes for access control. As the name suggests, this access control is based on roles. Although it is relatively simple to use, there is a role explosion problem for large-scale clusters—that is, there are too many roles, and the types are not static, making it difficult to track and audit role permission models. In addition, the access rights of roles in RBAC are fixed, and there is no provision for short-term use rights, nor does it take into account attributes such as location, time, or equipment. Enterprises using RBAC have difficulty meeting complex access control requirements to meet the regulatory requirements that other organizations demand.\n\nNGAC, or Next Generation Access Control, takes the approach of modeling access decision data as a graph. NGAC enables a systematic, policy-consistent approach to access control, granting or denying user management capabilities with a high level of granularity. NGAC was developed by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and is currently used for rights management in Tetrate Service Bridge. For more information on why you should choose NGAC over ABAC and RBAC, please refer to the blog post Why you should choose NGAC as your permission control model.\n\n## Hybrid cloud\n\nIn practical applications, we may deploy multiple Kubernetes clusters in various environments for reasons such as load balancing; isolation of development and production environments; decoupling of data processing and data storage; cross-cloud backup and disaster recovery; and avoiding vendor lock-in. The Kubernetes community provides a \u0022cluster federation\u0022 function that can help us create a multi-cluster architecture, such as the common Kubernetes multi-cluster architecture shown in the figure below, in which the host cluster serves as the control plane and has two member clusters, namely West and East.\n\n![Kubernetes Cluster Federation Architecture](multicluster.svg)\n\nCluster federation requires that the networks between the host cluster and member clusters can communicate with each other but does not require network connectivity between member clusters. The host cluster serves as the API entry, and all resource requests from the outside world to the host cluster will be forwarded to the member clusters. The control plane of the cluster federation is deployed in the host cluster, and the \u0022Push Reconciler\u0022 in it will propagate the identities, roles, and role bindings in the federation to all member clusters. Cluster federation simply \u0022connects\u0022 multiple clusters together, replicating workloads among multiple clusters, and the traffic between member clusters cannot be scheduled, nor can true multi-tenancy be achieved.\n\nCluster federation is not enough to realize hybrid clouds. In order to realize hybrid clouds in the true sense, it is necessary to achieve interconnection between clusters and realize multi-tenancy at the same time. TSB builds a general control plane for multi-cluster management on top of Istio and then adds a management plane to manage multi-clusters, providing functions such as multi-tenancy, management configuration, and observability. Below is a diagram of the multi-tenancy and API of the Istio management plane.\n\n![Schematic diagram of TSB\u0027s management plane built on top of Istio](tsb-management-plane.svg)\n\nIn order to manage the hybrid cloud, TSB built a management plane based on Istio, created tenant and workspace resources, and applied the gateway group, traffic group, and security group to the workloads in the corresponding cluster through selectors. For the detailed architecture of TSB, please refer to the [TSB documentation](https:\/\/docs.tetrate.io\/service-bridge).\n\nThanks for reading.\n', '\/en\/blog\/beyond-istio-oss\/')">
