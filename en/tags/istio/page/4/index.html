              <a href="#" onclick="exportToMarkdown('Transparent Traffic Intercepting and Routing in the L4 Network of Istio Ambient Mesh', 'This article details transparent traffic intercepting and L4 traffic paths in Ambient Mesh in both diagrammatic and hands-on form.', '\nAmbient mesh is an experimental new deployment model recently introduced to Istio. It splits the duties currently performed by the Envoy sidecar into two separate components: a node-level component for encryption (called “ztunnel”) and an L7 Envoy instance deployed per service for all other processing (called “waypoint”). The ambient mesh model is an attempt to gain some efficiencies in potentially improved lifecycle and resource management. You can learn more about what ambient mesh is and how it differs from the Sidecar pattern [here](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/ambient-mesh-what-you-need-to-know-about-this-experimental-new-deployment-model-for-istio\/).\n\nThis article takes you step-by-step through a hands-on approach to the transparent traffic intercepting and routing of L4 traffic paths in the Istio’s Ambient mode. If you don’t know what Ambient mode is, [this article](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/ambient-mesh-what-you-need-to-know-about-this-experimental-new-deployment-model-for-istio\/) can help you understand.\n\nIf you want to skip the actual hands-on steps and just want to know the L4 traffic path in Ambient mode, please see the figure below, it shows a Pod of Service A calling a Pod of Service B on a different node below.\n\n![Figure 1: Transparent traffic intercepting and routing in the L4 network of Istio Ambient Mesh](ambient-mesh-l4-traffic-path.svg)\n\n### Principles\n\nAmbient mode uses [tproxy](https:\/\/www.kernel.org\/doc\/Documentation\/networking\/tproxy.txt) and [HTTP Based Overlay Network Environment (HBONE)](https:\/\/pkg.go.dev\/github.com\/costinm\/hbone) as key technologies for transparent traffic intercepting and routing:\n\n- Using tproxy to intercept the traffic from the host Pod into the Ztunnel (Envoy Proxy).\n- Using HBONE to establish a tunnel for passing TCP traffic between Ztunnels.\n\n### What Is tproxy?\n\ntproxy is a transparent proxy supported by the Linux kernel since version 2.2, where the t stands for transparent. You need to enable \u0060NETFILTER_TPROXY\u0060 and policy routing in the kernel configuration. With tproxy, the Linux kernel can act as a router and redirect packets to user space. See the [tproxy documentation](http:\/\/lxr.linux.no\/linux\u002bv3.10\/Documentation\/networking\/tproxy.txt) for details.\n\n### What Is HBONE?\n\nHBONE is a method of providing tunneling capabilities using the HTTP protocol. A client sends an [HTTP CONNECT](https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/HTTP\/Methods\/CONNECT) request (which contains the destination address) to an HTTP proxy server to establish a tunnel, and the proxy server establishes a TCP connection to the destination on behalf of the client, which can then transparently transport TCP data streams to the destination server through the proxy. In Ambient mode, Ztunnel (Envoy inside) acts as a transparent proxy, using [Envoy Internal Listener](https:\/\/www.envoyproxy.io\/docs\/envoy\/latest\/configuration\/other_features\/internal_listener) to receive HTTP CONNECT requests and pass TCP streams to the upstream cluster.\n\n## Environment\n\nBefore starting the hands-on, it is necessary to explain the demo environment, and the corresponding object names in this article:\n\n| Items             | Name                                           | IP            |\n| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :------------ |\n| Service A Pod     | \u0060sleep-5644bdc767-2dfg7\u0060                       | 10.4.4.19     |\n| Service B Pod     | \u0060productpage-v1-5586c4d4ff-qxz9f\u0060              | 10.4.3.20     |\n| Ztunnel A Pod     | \u0060ztunnel-rts54\u0060                                | 10.4.4.18     |\n| Ztunnel B Pod     | \u0060ztunnel-z4qmh\u0060                                | 10.4.3.14     |\n| Node A            | \u0060gke-jimmy-cluster-default-pool-d5041909-d10i\u0060 | 10.168.15.222 |\n| Node B            | \u0060gke-jimmy-cluster-default-pool-d5041909-c1da\u0060 | 10.168.15.224 |\n| Service B Cluster | \u0060productpage\u0060                                  | 10.8.14.226   |\n\nBecause these names will be used in subsequent command lines, the text will use pronouns, so that you can experiment in your own environment.\n\nFor the tutorial, I installed Istio Ambient mode in GKE. You can refer to this [Istio blog post](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2022\/get-started-ambient\/) for installation instructions. Be careful not to install the Gateway, so as not to enable the L7 functionality; otherwise, the traffic path will be different from the descriptions in this blog.\n\nIn the following, we will experiment and dive into the L4 traffic path of a pod of \u0060sleep\u0060 service to a pod of \u0060productpage\u0060 service on different nodes. We will look at the outbound and inbound traffic of the Pods separately.\n\n## Outbound Traffic Intercepting\n\nThe transparent traffic intercepting process for outbound traffic from a pod in Ambient mesh is as follows:\n\n1. Istio CNI creates the \u0060istioout\u0060 NIC and iptables rules on the node, adds the Pods’ IP in Ambient mesh to the [IP set](https:\/\/ipset.netfilter.org\/), and transparently intercepts outbound traffic from Ambient mesh to \u0060pistioout\u0060 virtual NIC through [Geneve (Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation)](https:\/\/datatracker.ietf.org\/doc\/rfc8926\/) tunnels with netfilter \u0060nfmark\u0060 tags and routing rules.\n2. The init container in Ztunnel creates iptables rules that forward all traffic from the \u0060pistioout\u0060 NIC to port 15001 of the Envoy proxy in Ztunnel.\n3. Envoy processes the packets and establishes an HBONE tunnel (HTTP CONNECT) with the upstream endpoints to forward the packets upstream.\n\n### Check The Routing Rules On Node A\n\nLog in to Node A, where Service A is located, and use \u0060iptables-save\u0060 to check the rules.\n\n{{\u003chighlight bash \u0022linenos=table,hl_lines=3 4 6 35\u0022\u003e}}\n$ iptables-save\n\/* omit *\/\n-A PREROUTING -j ztunnel-PREROUTING\n-A PREROUTING -m comment --comment \u0022kubernetes service portals\u0022 -j KUBE-SERVICES\n-A ztunnel-POSTROUTING -m mark --mark 0x100\/0x100 -j ACCEPT\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -m mark --mark 0x100\/0x100 -j ACCEPT\n\/* omit *\/\n*mangle\n\/* omit *\/\n-A PREROUTING -j ztunnel-PREROUTING\n-A INPUT -j ztunnel-INPUT\n-A FORWARD -j ztunnel-FORWARD\n-A OUTPUT -j ztunnel-OUTPUT\n-A OUTPUT -s 169.254.169.254\/32 -j DROP\n-A POSTROUTING -j ztunnel-POSTROUTING\n-A ztunnel-FORWARD -m mark --mark 0x220\/0x220 -j CONNMARK --save-mark --nfmask 0x220 --ctmask 0x220\n-A ztunnel-FORWARD -m mark --mark 0x210\/0x210 -j CONNMARK --save-mark --nfmask 0x210 --ctmask 0x210\n-A ztunnel-INPUT -m mark --mark 0x220\/0x220 -j CONNMARK --save-mark --nfmask 0x220 --ctmask 0x220\n-A ztunnel-INPUT -m mark --mark 0x210\/0x210 -j CONNMARK --save-mark --nfmask 0x210 --ctmask 0x210\n-A ztunnel-OUTPUT -s 10.4.4.1\/32 -j MARK --set-xmark 0x220\/0xffffffff\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -i istioin -j MARK --set-xmark 0x200\/0x200\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -i istioin -j RETURN\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -i istioout -j MARK --set-xmark 0x200\/0x200\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -i istioout -j RETURN\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -p udp -m udp --dport 6081 -j RETURN\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -m connmark --mark 0x220\/0x220 -j MARK --set-xmark 0x200\/0x200\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -m mark --mark 0x200\/0x200 -j RETURN\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING ! -i veth300a1d80 -m connmark --mark 0x210\/0x210 -j MARK --set-xmark 0x40\/0x40\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -m mark --mark 0x40\/0x40 -j RETURN\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING ! -s 10.4.4.18\/32 -i veth300a1d80 -j MARK --set-xmark 0x210\/0x210\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -m mark --mark 0x200\/0x200 -j RETURN\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -i veth300a1d80 -j MARK --set-xmark 0x220\/0x220\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -p udp -j MARK --set-xmark 0x220\/0x220\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -m mark --mark 0x200\/0x200 -j RETURN\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -p tcp -m set --match-set ztunnel-pods-ips src -j MARK --set-xmark 0x100\/0x100\n{{\u003c\/highlight\u003e}}\n\nIPtables rule descriptions:\n\n- Line 3: the \u0060PREROUTING\u0060 chain is the first to run, and all packets will go to the \u0060ztunnel-PEROUTING\u0060 chain first.\n- Line 4: packets are sent to the \u0060KUBE-SERVICES\u0060 chain, where the Cluster IP of the Kubernetes Service is DNAT’d to the Pod IP.\n- Line 6: packets with \u00600x100\/0x100\u0060 flags pass through the \u0060PREROUTING\u0060 chain and no longer go through the \u0060KUBE-SERVICES\u0060 chain.\n- Line 35: this is the last rule added to the \u0060ztunnel-PREROUTING\u0060 chain; all TCP packets entering the \u0060ztunnel-PREROUTING\u0060 chain that are in the \u0060ztunnel-pods-ips\u0060 [IP set](https:\/\/ipset.netfilter.org\/) (created by the Istio CNI) are marked with 0x100\/0x100, which overrides all previous marks. See the [Netfilter documentation](https:\/\/ipset.netfilter.org\/iptables-extensions.man.html#lbDD) for more information about \u0060nfmark\u0060.\n\nBy implementing the above iptables rules, we can ensure that ambient mesh only intercepts packets from the \u0060ztunnel-pods-ips\u0060 IP set pods and marks the packets with \u00600x100\/0x100\u0060 (\u0060nfmark\u0060, in value\/mask format, both value and mask are 32-bit binary integers) without affecting other pods.\n\nLet’s look at the routing rules for this node.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\n$ ip rule\n0:      from all lookup local\n100:    from all fwmark 0x200\/0x200 goto 32766\n101:    from all fwmark 0x100\/0x100 lookup 101\n102:    from all fwmark 0x40\/0x40 lookup 102\n103:    from all lookup 100\n32766:  from all lookup main\n32767:  from all lookup default\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThe routing table will be executed sequentially, with the first column indicating the priority of the routing table and the second column indicating the routing table to look for or jump to. You will see that all packets marked with \u00600x100\/0x100\u0060 will look for the 101 routing table. Let’s look at that routing table.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\n$ ip route show table 101\ndefault via 192.168.127.2 dev istioout \n10.4.4.18 dev veth52b75946 scope link \n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nYou will see the 101 routing table with the keyword via, which indicates that the packets will be transmitted through the gateway, [see the usage of the ip route command](http:\/\/linux-ip.net\/html\/tools-ip-route.html#tools-ip-route-show). All packets are sent through the \u0060istioout\u0060 NIC to the gateway (IP is \u0060192.168.127.2\u0060).

Let’s see how Ztunnel routes outbound traffic.\n\n\u003e Note: The Envoy filter rules in Ztunnel are completely different from the Envoy filter rules in Sidecar mode, so instead of using the \u0060istioctl proxy-config\u0060 command to inspect the configuration of Listener, Cluster, Endpoint, etc., we directly export the complete Envoy configuration in Ztunnel.\n\nYou can get the Envoy configuration in Ztunnel A directly and remotely on your local machine\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl exec -n istio-system ztunnel-hptxk -c istio-proxy -- curl \u0022127.0.0.1:15000\/config_dump?include_eds\u0022\u003eztunnel-a-all-include-eds.json\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n\u003e Note: Do not use \u0060istioctl proxy-config all ztunnel-rts54 -n istio-system\u0060 command to get the Envoy configuration, because the configuration so obtained does not contain the EDS part. The exported JSON file will have tens of thousands of lines, so it is recommended to use [fx](https:\/\/github.com\/antonmedv\/fx) or other tools to parse the file for readability.\n\n### Ztunnel_outbound Listener\n\nThe Envoy configuration contains the traffic rule configuration for all pods on this node.

Inbound traffic intercepting in Ambient mode is similar to outbound. It also uses tproxy and HBONE to achieve transparent traffic intercepting.\n\nThe transparent traffic intercepting process for inbound traffic to the pod of Ambient mesh is as follows:\n\n1. Istio CNI creates the istioin NIC and iptables rules on the node, adds the pods IP in Ambient mesh to the IP set, and transparently hijacks outbound traffic from Ambient mesh to the pistioin VM through the Geneve tunnel by using Netfilter nfmark tags and routing rules. NICs.\n2. The init container in Ztunnel creates iptables rules that forward all traffic from the pistioin NIC to port 15008 of the Envoy proxy in Ztunnel.\n3. Envoy processes the packets and forwards them to Pod B.\n\nSince the checking procedure is similar to the outbound traffic, some of the output will be omitted below.\n\n### Check the Routing Rules on Node B\n\nLog in to Node B, where Service B is located, and check the iptables on the node:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\n$ iptables-save\n\/* omit *\/\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -m mark --mark 0x200\/0x200 -j RETURN\n-A ztunnel-PREROUTING -p tcp -m set --match-set ztunnel-pods-ips src -j MARK --set-xmark 0x100\/0x100\n\/* omit *\/\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nYou will see the previous command mentioned in the previous section to mark all packets sent by the pods in the \u0060ztunnel-pods-ips\u0060 IP set with 0x100\/0x100: mark all packets with 0x200\/0x200, and then continue with iptables.\n\nLook into the routing table on node B:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\n0:      from all lookup local\n100:    from all fwmark 0x200\/0x200 goto 32766\n101:    from all fwmark 0x100\/0x100 lookup 101\n102:    from all fwmark 0x40\/0x40 lookup 102\n103:    from all lookup 100\n32766:  from all lookup main\n32767:  from all lookup default\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThe number of routing tables and rules are the same in all the nodes which belong to the ambient mesh. The routing table rules will be executed sequentially, looking first for the local table, then all packets with \u00600x200\/0x200\u0060 flags will first jump to the main table (where veth routes are defined), and then to the 100 table, where the following rules are in place:\n\n{{\u003chighlight bash \u0022linenos=table,hl_lines=8\u0022\u003e}}\n$ ip route show table 100\n10.4.3.14 dev veth28865c45 scope link \n10.4.3.15 via 192.168.126.2 dev istioin src 10.4.3.1\n10.4.3.16 via 192.168.126.2 dev istioin src 10.4.3.1\n10.4.3.17 via 192.168.126.2 dev istioin src 10.4.3. \n10.4.3.18 via 192.168.126.2 dev istioin src 10.4.3. \n10.4.3.19 via 192.168.126.2 dev istioin src 10.4.3.1\n10.4.3.20 via 192.168.126.2 dev istioin src 10.4.3.1\n{{\u003c\/highlight\u003e}}\n\nYou will see that packets destined for \u006010.4.3.20\u0060 will be routed to the \u0060192.168.126.2\u0060 gateway on the istioin NIC.\n\nLook into the details of the istioin NIC:\n\n{{\u003chighlight bash \u0022linenos=table,hl_lines=4 5\u0022\u003e}}\n$ ip -d addr show istioin \n17: istioin: \u003cBROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP\u003e mtu 1410 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default \n    link\/ether 36:2a:2f:f1:5c:97 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff promiscuity 0 minmtu 68 maxmtu 65485 \n    geneve id 1000 remote 10.4.3.14 ttl auto dstport 6081 noudpcsum udp6zerocsumrx numtxqueues 1 numrxqueues 1 gso_max_size 65536 gso_max_segs 65535 \n    inet 192.168.126.1\/30 brd 192.168.126.3 scope global istioin\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n    inet6 fe80::342a:2fff:fef1:5c97\/64 scope link \n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n{{\u003c\/highlight\u003e}}\n\nAs you can see from the output, \u0060istioin\u0060 is a Geneve-type virtual NIC that creates a Geneve tunnel with a remote IP of \u006010.4.3.14\u0060, which is the Pod IP of Ztunnel B.\n\n###  Check The Routing Rules On Ztunnel B Pod\n\nGo to the Ztunnel B Pod and use the \u0060ip -d a\u0060 command to check its NIC information. You will see that there is a \u0060pistioout\u0060 NIC with an IP of \u0060192.168.127.2\u0060, which is the far end of the Geneve tunnel created with the \u0060istioout\u0060 virtual NIC.\n\nUse iptables-save to view the iptables rules within the Pod, and you will see that:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\n-A PREROUTING -i pistioin -p tcp -m tcp --dport 15008 -j TPROXY --on-port 15008 --on-ip 127.0.0.1 --tproxy-mark 0x400\/0xfff\n-A PREROUTING -i pistioin -p tcp -j TPROXY --on-port 15006 --on-ip 127.0.0.1 --tproxy-mark 0x400\/0xfff\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nAll traffic destined for 10.4.3.20:15008 will be routed to port 15008 using tproxy.\n\n**15006 and 15008**\n\n- Port 15006 is used to process non-encrypted (plain) TCP packets.\n\n- Port 15008 is used to process encrypted (TLS) TCP packets.\n\nThe above is the transparent intercepting process of inbound traffic in the Pod.\n\n## Inbound Traffic Routing On Ztunnel B\n\nThe outbound TLS encrypted traffic is intercepted on Ztunnel and goes to Envoy’s port 15008 for processing. Let’s look at how Ztunnel routes inbound traffic.\n\nLet’s remotely get the Envoy configuration in Ztunnel B directly on our local machine.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl exec -n istio-system

ORIGINAL_DST, indicating that the original downstream destination is used as the route destination, i.e. \u006010.4.3.20:15008\u0060, which has an incorrect port in this address.\n- Line 9: a \u0060use_http_header\u0060 of true will use the HTTP header x-envoy-original-dst-host as the destination, which has been set to \u006010.4.3.20:9080\u0060 in the outbound Ztunnel, and it will override the previously set destination address.\n\nAt this point, the inbound traffic is accurately routed to the destination by Ztunnel. The above is the flow of L4 traffic hijacking and routing between nodes in Ambient mode.\n\n## Summary\n\nFor demonstration purposes, this article shows the paths of L4 network access packets for services on different nodes, even if the paths are similar for two services on the same node. Istio’s Ambient mode is still in its infancy, and during my testing, I also found that the EDS in the exported Envoy configuration was missing the cluster_name field. After understanding the L4 traffic path, I will share the L7 traffic path in Ambient mode in the future. Stay tuned.\n\n---\n\nIf you’re new to service mesh and Kubernetes security, we have a bunch of free online courses [available at Tetrate Academy](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/academy) that will quickly get you up to speed with Istio and Envoy.\n\nIf you’re looking for a fast way to get to production with Istio, check out [Tetrate Istio Distribution (TID)](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/tid) . TID is Tetrate’s hardened, fully upstream Istio distribution, with FIPS-verified builds and support available. It’s a great way to get started with Istio knowing you have a trusted distribution to begin with, have an expert team supporting you, and also have the option to get to FIPS compliance quickly if you need to.Once you have Istio up and running, you will probably need simpler ways to manage and secure your services beyond what’s available in Istio, that’s where Tetrate Service Bridge comes in. You can learn more about how Tetrate Service Bridge makes service mesh more secure, manageable, and resilient [here](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/tsb) , or [contact us for a quick demo](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/contact) .\n\n*This blog was originally published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/transparent-traffic-intercepting-and-routing-in-the-l4-network-of-istio-ambient-mesh\/).*\n', '\/en\/blog\/ambient-mesh-l4-traffic-path\/')">

With CNCF’s strong community and marketing resources, and Ambient Mesh further lowering the barrier to trying Istio, the five year old open source project has been revitalized.\n\nIf you don’t know about service mesh and Istio, or are curious about the future of Istio, this eBook—[The Current State and Future of the Istio Service Mesh](https:\/\/www.tetrate-old.local\/get-insights-into-history-and-future-of-istio-content\/) will give you the answers. The following is an excerpt from the book. In my view, the future of Istio lies in being the infrastructure for zero-trust network and hybrid cloud.\n\n## Zero Trust\n\nZero trust is an important topic, including when I spoke at IstioCon 2022. Istio is becoming an important part of zero trust, the most important element of which is identity-oriented control rather than network-oriented control.\n\n### What Is Zero Trust?\n\nZero trust is a security philosophy, not a best practice that all security teams follow in the same way. The concept of zero trust was proposed to bring a more secure network to the cloud-native world. Zero trust is a theoretical state where all consumers within a network not only have no authority but also have no awareness of the surrounding network. The main challenges of zero trust are the increasingly granular authorization and the need for a time limit for user authorization.\n\n## Authentication\n\nIstio 1.14 adds support for the SPIFFE Runtime Environment (SPIRE). SPIRE, a CNCF incubation project, is an implementation of the Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone (SPIFFE), also a CNCF Incubation Project. In Kubernetes, we use ServiceAccount to provide identity information for workloads in Pods, and its core is based on Token (using Secret resource storage) to represent workload identity. A token is a resource in a Kubernetes cluster. How to unify the identities of multiple clusters and workloads running in non-Kubernetes environments (such as virtual machines)? That’s what SPIFFE is trying to solve.\n\nThe purpose of SPIFFE is to establish an open and unified workload identity standard based on the concept of zero trust, which helps to establish a fully identifiable data center network with zero trust. The core of SPIFFE is to define a short-lived encrypted identity document—SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document (SVID)—through a simple API, which is used as an identity document (based on an X.509 certificate or JWT token) for workload authentication. SPIRE can automatically rotate SVID certificates and keys according to administrator-defined policies, dynamically provide workload identities, and Istio can dynamically consume these workload identities through SPIRE.\n\nThe Kubernetes-based SPIRE architecture diagram is shown below.\n\n![Figure 1: SPIRE deployed in Kubernetes](spire.svg)\n\nIstio originally used the Citadel service in Istiod to be responsible for certificate management in the service mesh, and issued the certificate to the data plane through the xDS (to be precise, SDS API) protocol. With SPIRE, the work of certificate management is handed over to SPIRE Server. SPIRE also supports the Envoy SDS API. After we enable SPIRE in Istio, the traffic entering the workload pod will be authenticated once after being transparently intercepted into the sidecar. The purpose of authentication is to compare the identity of the workload with the environment information it runs on (node, Pod’s ServiceAccount and Namespace, etc.) to prevent identity forgery. Please refer to[ How to Integrate SPIRE in Istio](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/ops\/integrations\/spire\/) to learn how to use SPIRE for authentication in Istio.\n\nWe can deploy SPIRE in Kubernetes using the Kubernetes Workload Registrar, which automatically registers the workload in Kubernetes for us and generates an SVID. The registration machine is a Server-Agent architecture, which deploys a SPIRE Agent on each node, and the Agent communicates with the workload through a shared UNIX Domain Socket. The following diagram shows the process of using SPIRE for authentication in Istio.\n\n![Figure 2: SPIRE-based workload authentication process in Istio](spire-auth.svg)\n\nThe steps to using SPIRE for workload authentication in Istio are as follows:\n\n- To obtain the SIVD, the SPIRE Agent is referred to as a pilot-agent via shared UDS.\n- The SPIRE Agent asks Kubernetes (to be precise, the kubelet on the node) for load information.\n- The kubelet returns the information queried from the API server to the workload validator.\n- The validator compares the result returned by the kubelet with the identity information shared by the sidecar. If it is the same, it returns the correct SVID cache to the workload. If it is different, the authentication fails.\n\n Please refer to the SPIRE documentation for the detailed process of registering and authenticating workloads.\n\n## NGAC\n\nWhen each workload has an accurate identity, how can the permissions of these identities be restricted? Role-based access control (RBAC) is used by default in Kubernetes for access control. As the name suggests, this access control is based on roles. Although it is relatively simple to use, there is a role explosion problem for large-scale clusters—that is, there are too many roles, and the types are not static, making it difficult to track and audit role permission models. In addition, the access rights of roles in RBAC are fixed, and there is no provision for short-term use rights; nor does it take into account attributes such as location, time, or equipment. Enterprises using RBAC have difficulty meeting complex access control requirements to comply with the regulatory requirements that other organizations demand.\n\nNGAC, or Next Generation Access Control, takes the approach of modeling access decision data as a graph. NGAC enables a systematic, policy-consistent approach to access control, granting or denying user management capabilities with a high level of granularity. NGAC was developed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and is currently used for rights management in [Tetrate Service Bridge (TSB).](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/tetrate-service-bridge) For more information, read our article on [why you should choose NGAC over ABAC and RBAC](https:\/\/thenewstack.io\/why-you-should-choose-ngac-as-your-access-control-model).\n\n## Hybrid cloud\n\nIn practical applications, we may deploy multiple Kubernetes clusters in various environments for reasons such as load balancing; isolation of development and production environments; decoupling of data processing and data storage; cross-cloud backup and disaster recovery; and avoiding vendor lock-in. The Kubernetes community provides a “cluster federation” function that can help us create a multi-cluster architecture, such as the common Kubernetes multi-cluster architecture shown in the figure below, in which the host cluster serves as the control plane and has two member clusters, namely West and East.\n\n![Figure 3: Kubernetes cluster federation architecture](federation.svg)\n\nCluster federation requires that the networks between the host cluster and member clusters can communicate with each other, but it does not require network connectivity between member clusters. The host cluster serves as the API entry, and all resource requests from the outside world to the host cluster will be forwarded to the member clusters.\n\nThe control plane of the cluster federation is deployed in the host cluster, and the “Push Reconciler” in it will propagate the identities, roles, and role bindings in the federation to all member clusters. Cluster federation simply “connects” multiple clusters together, replicating workloads among multiple clusters, and the traffic between member clusters cannot be scheduled, nor can true multi-tenancy be achieved.\n\nCluster federation is not enough to realize hybrid clouds. In order to realize hybrid clouds in the true sense, it is necessary to achieve interconnection between clusters and realize multi-tenancy at the same time. Tetrate Service Bridge provides a general control plane for multi-cluster management on top of Istio and then adds a management plane to manage multiple clusters, providing functions such as multi-tenancy, management configuration, and observability. Below is a diagram of the multi-tenancy and API of the Istio management plane.\n\n![Figure 4: TSB’s management plane built on top of Istio](tsb.svg)\n\nIn order to manage the hybrid cloud, TSB uses a management plane based on Istio, creates tenant and workspace resources, and applies the gateway group, traffic group, and security group to the workloads in the corresponding cluster through selectors.\n\nTetrate provides an enterprise-level service mesh management plane that works across clusters, across clouds, and with on-premises deployments, including VMs and bare metal servers. At Tetrate, we are committed to building an application-aware network suitable for any environment and any workload and providing a zero-trust hybrid cloud platform. And we contribute to building needed infrastructure in open source wherever possible; only management-plane-specific functionality is reserved for the commercial software offering.\n\nThe figure shown below is the architecture diagram of Tetrate’s flagship product, Tetrate Service Bridge.\n\n![Figure 5: Tetrate Service Bridge architecture](tsb-org.svg)\n\nFor the detailed architecture of TSB, please refer to the [TSB documentation](https:\/\/docs.tetrate.io\/service-bridge).\n\n## Get the eBook\n\nThe above is just a summary of what we see for the future of Istio.

This book provides detailed information on:\n\n- The rise of service mesh technology is due to the popularity of Kubernetes, microservices, DevOps, and cloud native architectures.\n- The emergence of Kubernetes and programmable proxies, which laid a solid foundation for Istio.\n- How eBPF can accelerate transparent traffic hijacking in Istio, but cannot replace the sidecar in the service mesh.\n- How the future of Istio lies in building a zero trust network based on the hybrid cloud.\n\nIn addition, there are also numerous illustrations in the book that will help you understand. With the entry of Istio into CNCF and the introduction of the latest Ambient Mesh, we can expect that Istio will be even easier to adopt, and continue to grow in features, capabilities, and community.\n\n---\n\n*This blog was originally published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/the-future-of-istio-the-path-to-zero-trust-security\/).*\n', '\/en\/blog\/the-future-of-istio\/')">

The main points of view in this article are as follows:\n\n- Due to the popularity of Kubernetes, microservices, DevOps, and cloud-native architectures, the rise of service mesh technology.\n- The rise of Kubernetes and programmable proxies has laid the technical groundwork for Istio\u0027s implementation.\n- While eBPF can accelerate transparent traffic hijacking in Istio, it can not replace sidecars in service meshes.\n- The future of Istio is to build a zero-trust network.\n\nNext, we start this article with the background of the birth of Istio.\n\n## The eve of the birth of Istio\n\nSince 2013, with the explosion of the mobile Internet, enterprises have had higher requirements for the efficiency of application iteration. Application architecture has begun to shift from monolithic to microservices, and DevOps has also become popular. In the same year, with the open source of Docker, the problems of application encapsulation and isolation were solved, making it easier to schedule applications in the orchestration system. In 2014, Kubernetes and Spring Boot were open-sourced, and Spring framework development of microservice applications became popular. In the next few years, a large number of RPC middleware open source projects appeared, such as Google released gRPC 1.0 in 2016. The service framework is in full bloom. In order to save costs, increase development efficiency, and make applications more flexible, more and more enterprises are migrating to the cloud, but this is not just as simple as moving applications to the cloud. In order to use cloud computing more efficiently, a set of \u0022cloud native\u0022 methods and concepts are also on the horizon.\n\n## Istio Open Source Timeline\n\nLet\u0027s briefly review the major events of Istio open source:\n\n- **September 2016**: Since Envoy is an important part of Istio, Istio\u0027s open source timeline should have an Envoy part. At first, Envoy was only used as an edge proxy inside Lyft, and it was verified in large-scale production inside Lyft before Envoy was open sourced. In fact, Envoy was open sourced before it was open sourced, and it got the attention of Google engineers. At that time, Google was planning to launch an open source project of service mesh, and initially planned to use Nginx as a proxy. In 2017, Envoy donated to [CNCF](https:\/\/cncf.io\/).\n- **May 2017**: Istio was announced as open source by Google, IBM, and Lyft. The microservices architecture was used from the beginning. The composition of the data plane, control plane, and sidecar pattern were determined.\n- **March 2018**: Kubernetes successfully became the first project to graduate from CNCF, becoming more and more \u0022boring\u0022. The basic API has been finalized. In the second edition, CNCF officially wrote the service mesh into the cloud native first definition. The company I currently work for, [Tetrate](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/), was founded by the Google Istio team.\n- **July 2018**: Istio 1.0 is released, billed as \u0022production ready\u0022.\n- **March 2020**: Istio 1.5 was released, the architecture returned to a monolithic application, the release cycle was determined, a major version was released every three months, and the API became stable.\n- **From 2020 to the present**: The development of Istio mainly focuses on Day 2 operation, performance optimization, and extensibility. Several open source projects in the Istio ecosystem have begun to emerge, such as [Slime](https:\/\/github.com\/slime-io\/slime\/), [Areaki](https:\/\/github.com\/aeraki-mesh\/aeraki), and [Merbridge](https:\/\/github.com\/merbridge\/merbridge).\n\n## Why did Istio come after Kubernetes?\n\nThe emergence mentioned here refers to the birth of the concept of \u0022service mesh\u0022. After microservices and containerization, the increase in the use of heterogeneous languages, the surge in the number of services, and the shortened life cycle of containers are the fundamental reasons for the emergence of service meshes.\n\nTo make it possible for developers to manage traffic between services with minimal cost, Istio needs to solve three problems:\n\n1. Transparent traffic hijacks traffic between applications, which means that developers can quickly use the capabilities brought by Istio without modifying applications.\n1. Another point is the operation and maintenance level; how to inject the proxy into each application and manage these distributed sidecar proxies efficiently.\n1. An efficient and scalable sidecar proxy that can be configured through an API.\n\nThe above three conditions are indispensable for the Istio service mesh, and we can see from them that these requirements are basically the requirements for the sidecar proxy. The choice of this proxy will directly affect the direction and success of the project.\n\nIn order to solve the three problems above, Istio chose:\n\n1. Container Orchestration and Scheduling Platform: Kubernetes\n1. Programable proxy: Envoy\n\nFrom the figure below, we can see the transition of the service deployment architecture from Kubernetes to Istio, with many changes and constants.\n\n![Schematic diagram of the architectural change from Kubernetes to Istio](kubernetes-to-istio.svg)\n\nFrom Kubernetes to Istio, in a nutshell, the deployment architecture of the application has the following characteristics:\n\n- Kubernetes manages the life cycle of applications, specifically, application deployment and management (scaling, automatic recovery, and release).\n- Automatic sidecar injection based on Kubernetes to achieve transparent traffic interception. First, the inter-service traffic is intercepted through the sidecar proxy, and then the behavior of the microservice is managed through the control plane configuration. Nowadays, the deployment mode of service mesh has also ushered in new challenges. A sidecar is no longer necessary for Istio service mesh. The proxyless service mesh based on gRPC is also being tested.\n- The service mesh decouples traffic management from Kubernetes, and the traffic inside the service mesh does not need the support of the kube-proxy component. Through the abstraction close to the microservice application layer, the traffic between services is managed to achieve security and observability functions.\n- The control plane issues proxy configuration to the data plane through the xDS protocol. The proxies that have implemented xDS include [Envoy](https:\/\/envoyproxy.io\/) and the open source [MOSN](https:\/\/mosn.io\/).\n- When a client outside the Kubernetes cluster accesses the internal services of the cluster, it was originally through Kubernetes Ingress, but after Istio is available, it will be accessed through Gateway.\n\n### Transparent traffic hijacking\n\nIf you are using middleware such as gRPC to develop microservices, after integrating the SDK into the program, the interceptor in the SDK will automatically intercept the traffic for you, as shown in the following figure.\n\n![Interceptor diagram of gRPC](grpc.svg)\n\nHow to make the traffic in the Kubernetes pod go through the proxy? The answer is to inject a proxy into each application pod, share the network space with the application, and then modify the traffic path within the pod so that all traffic in and out of the pod goes through the sidecar. Its architecture is shown in the figure below.\n\n![Diagram of transparent traffic hijacking in Istio](istio-route-iptables.svg)\n\nFrom the figure, we can see that there is a very complex set of iptables traffic hijacking logic. The advantage of using iptables is that it is applicable to any Linux operating system. But this also has some side effects:\n\n1. All services in the Istio mesh need to add a network hop when entering and leaving the pod. Although each hop may only be two or three milliseconds, as the dependencies between services and services in the mesh increase, this latency may increase significantly, which may not be suitable for service meshes for services that pursue low latency.\n1. Because Istio injects a large number of sidecars into the data plane, especially when the number of services increases, the control plane needs to deliver more Envoy proxy configurations to the data plane, which will cause the data plane to occupy a lot of system memory and network resources.\n\nHow to optimize the service mesh in response to these two problems?\n\n1. Use proxyless mode: remove the sidecar proxy and go back to the SDK.\n1. Optimize the data plane: reduce the frequency and size of proxy configurations delivered to the data plane.\n1. eBPF: it can be used to optimize network hijacking.\n\nThis article will explain these details in the section on performance optimization later on.\n\n### Sidecar operation and maintenance management\n\nIstio is built on top of Kubernetes, which can leverage Kubernetes\u0027 container orchestration and lifecycle management to automatically inject sidecars into pods through admission controllers when Kubernetes creates pods. \n\nIn order to solve the resource consumption problem of Sidecar, some people have proposed four deployment modes for the service mesh, as shown in the following figure.\n\n![Schematic diagram of four deployment modes of service mesh](deployment-model.svg)\n\nThe following table compares these four deployment methods in detail. Each of them has advantages and disadvantages. The specific choice depends on the current situation.\n\n{{\u003ctable \u0022Comparison of four deployment modes of service mesh\u0022\u003e}}\n\n| **Mode**                                 | **Memory overhead**                                          | **Security**                                                 | **Fault domain**                                             | **Operation and maintenance**                                |\n| :--------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Sidecar proxy**                        | The overhead is greatest because a proxy is injected per pod. | Since the sidecar must be deployed with the workload, it is possible for the workload to bypass the sidecar. | Pod-level isolation, if the proxy fails, only the workload in the Pod is affected. | A workload\u0027s sidecar can be upgraded independently without affecting other workloads. |\n| **Node sharing proxy**                   | There is only one proxy on each node, shared by all workloads on that node, with low overhead. | There are security risks in the management of encrypted content and private keys. | Node-level isolation, if a version conflict, configuration conflict, or extension incompatibility occurs when a shared proxy is upgraded, it may affect all workloads on that node. | There is no need to worry about injecting sidecars.          |\n| **Service Account \/ Node Sharing Proxy** | All workloads under the service account\/identity use a shared proxy with little overhead. | Authentication and security of connections between workloads and proxy cannot be guaranteed. | The level isolation between nodes and service accounts, the fault is the same as \u0022node sharing proxy\u0022. | Same as \u0022node sharing proxy\u0022 mode.                           |\n| **Shared remote proxy with micro-proxy** | Because injecting a micro-proxy for each pod, the overhead is relatively large. | The micro-proxy handles mTLS exclusively and is not responsible for L7 routing, which can ensure security. | When a Layer 7 policy needs to be applied, the traffic of the workload instance is redirected to the L7 proxy, and can be bypassed directly if it is not needed.

I will quote some of his views below to illustrate the key role of programmable proxies in Istio.\n\nThe following figure shows the evolution process of the proxy software from configuration to programmable mode, and the representative proxy software in each stage.\n\n![Schematic diagram of the evolution of proxy software](proxy-evolution.svg)\n\nThe entire proxy evolution process is as the application moves from local and monolithic to large-scale and distributed. Below, I will briefly outline the evolution of the proxy software:\n\n- **The era of configuration files**: almost all software has configuration files, and proxy software is more inseparable from configuration files because of its relatively complex functions. The proxy at this stage is mainly developed using the C language, including its extension module, which highlights the ability of the proxy itself. This is also the most primitive and basic form of our use of proxies, including Nginx, Apache HTTP Server, [Squid](http:\/\/www.squid-cache.org\/), etc.\n- **Configuration language era**: Proxies in this era are more extensible and flexible, such as dynamic data acquisition and matching logic judgment. Varnish and HAProxy are two examples of representative software.\n- **The era of scripting languages**: Since the introduction of scripting languages, proxy software has become programmable. We can use scripts to add dynamic logic to proxies more easily, increasing development efficiency. The representative software is Nginx and its supported scripting languages.\n- **The era of clusters**: With the popularity of cloud computing, large-scale deployment and dynamic configuration of APIs have become necessary capabilities for proxies, and with the increase in network traffic, large-scale proxy clusters have emerged as the times require. The representative proxy software of this era includes Envoy, Kong, etc.\n- **Cloud-native era**: Multi-tenancy, elasticity, heterogeneous hybrid cloud, multi-cluster, security, and observability are all higher requirements for proxies in the cloud-native era. This will also be a historical opportunity for service meshes, with representative software such as Istio, Linkerd, and [Pypi](https:\/\/flomesh.io\/).\n\n## Are these all service meshes?\n\nSo, is it possible to build a service mesh with proxies? Now I will list the existing service mesh projects, and let\u0027s explore the development law and nature of service mesh together. The table below compares the current popular open source \u0022service mesh\u0022 projects.\n\n{{\u003ctable \u0022Service mesh open source project comparison table\u0022\u003e}}\n\n| Contrast           | Istio                                                        | Linkerd                                                     | Consul Connect                                               | Traefik Mesh                                                 | Kuma                                | Open Service Mesh (OSM)                       |\n| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |\n| Current version   | 1.14                                                         | 2.11                                                        | 1.12                                                         | 1.4                                                          | 1.5                                 | 1.0l                                          |\n| License           | Apache License 2.0                                           | Apache License 2.0                                          | Mozilla License                                              | Apache License 2.0                                           | Apache License 2.0                  | Apache License 2.0                            |\n| Initiator          | Google, IBM, Lyft                                            | Buoyant                                                     | HashiCorp                                                    | Traefik Labs                                                 | Kong                                | Microsoft                                     |\n| Service proxy | Envoy, which supports proxyless mode for gRPC                | [Linkerd2-proxy](https:\/\/github.com\/linkerd\/linkerd2-proxy) | Default is [Envoy](https:\/\/www.envoyproxy.io\/) , replaceable | [Traefik Proxy](https:\/\/traefik.io\/traefik\/)                 | [Envoy](https:\/\/www.envoyproxy.io\/) | [Envoy](https:\/\/www.envoyproxy.io\/)           |\n| Ingress controller | Envoy, custom Ingress, supports Kubernetes Gateway API       | no built-in                                                 | Envoy, with support for the Kubernetes Gateway API           | no built-in                                                  | Kong                                | Support Contour, Nginx, compatible with other |\n| Governance         | Istio Community and Open Usage Commons, proposed to donate to CNCF | CNCF                                                        | View [Contribution Guidelines](https:\/\/github.com\/hashicorp\/consul\/blob\/master\/.github\/CONTRIBUTING.md) | View [Contribution Guidelines](https:\/\/github.com\/traefik\/mesh\/blob\/master\/CONTRIBUTING.md) | CNCF                                | CNCF                                          |\n| Comment | It is one of the most popular service mesh projects at present. | The earliest service mesh, the creator of the concept of \u0022Service Mesh\u0022, the first service mesh project to enter CNCF, using a lightweight proxy developed with Rust. | Consul service mesh, using Envoy as a sidecar proxy. | A service mesh project launched by Traefik, using Traefik Proxy as a sidecar and supporting SMI (mentioned below). | A service mesh project launched by Kong that uses Envoy as a sidecar proxy, using Kong\u0027s own gateway as ingress. | An open source service mesh created by Microsoft, using Envoy as a sidecar, compatible with SMI (also proposed by Microsoft). |\n\n{{\u003c \/table \u003e}}\n\nThe open source projects in the above table are summarized below, and several projects closely related to service mesh are added, as follows:\n\n- [Envoy](https:\/\/envoyproxy.io\/): Envoy is a cloud-native proxy, frequently used as a sidecar in other Envoy-based service meshes and for building API Gateways.\n- [Service Mesh Performance (SMP)](https:\/\/smp-spec.io\/): Metrics that capture details of infrastructure capacity, service mesh configuration, and workload metadata to standardize service mesh values and describe the performance of any deployment.\n- [Service Mesh Interface (SMI)](https:\/\/smi-spec.io\/): It is not a service mesh, but a set of service mesh implementation standards. Similar to OAM, SPIFFE, CNI, CSI, etc., it defines interface standards, and the specific implementation varies. Currently, Traefik Mesh and Open Service Mesh claim to support this specification.\n- [Network Service Mesh](https:\/\/networkservicemesh.io\/): It\u0027s worth mentioning this project because it\u0027s often mistaken for a service mesh. In fact, it is oriented towards a three-layer network, and it can be used to connect multi-cloud\/hybrid clouds without changing the CNI plug-in. It\u0027s not a \u0022service mesh\u0022 as we define it, but a powerful complement to a service mesh (albeit a somewhat confusing name with a service mesh in it).\n\nLooking at the so-called \u0022service mesh\u0022 projects mentioned above, we can see that most service mesh project initiators start out as proxies, and then do the control plane. And Istio, Consul Connect, Open Service Mesh, and Kuma all use Envoy as a sidecar proxy. Only Linkerd and Traefik Mesh have launched their own proxies. And all service mesh projects support the sidecar pattern. Apart from Istio, Linkerd, and Consul Connect, which have been used in production, other service mesh projects are currently only \u0022toys\u0022.\n\n## Performance optimization for Istio\n\nAfter Istio 1.5 had a stable architecture, the community\u0027s main focus was on optimizing Istio\u0027s performance. Below, I will give you a detailed introduction to performance optimization methods in Istio, including:\n\n- Use the Proxyless mode.\n- Use eBPF to optimize traffic hijacking.\n- Optimization of control plane performance.\n- Optimization of data plane performance.\n\n### Proxyless mode\n\nProxyless mode is an experimental feature proposed by Istio in version 1.11-a service mesh without sidecar proxy based on gRPC and Istio. Using this pattern allows you to add gRPC services directly to Istio without injecting an Envoy proxy into the Pod. The figure below shows a comparison of sidecar mode and proxyless mode.\n\n![Sidecar vs Proxyless](sidecar-to-proxyless.svg)\n\nAs we can see from the above figure, although proxyless mode does not use a proxy for data plane communication, it still needs an agent for initialization and communication with the control plane. First, the agent generates a bootstrap file at startup, in the same way that it generates bootstrap files for Envoy. This tells the gRPC library how to connect to Istiod, where to find certificates for data plane communication, and what metadata to send to the control plane. Next, the agent acts as an xDS proxy, connecting and authenticating with \u0060Istiod\u0060. Finally, the agent obtains and rotates the certificate used in the data plane communication.\n\n\u003e *The essence of a service mesh is not a sidecar model, nor a configuration center, or transparent traffic interception, but a standardized inter-service communication standard.*\n\nSome people say that the proxyless model has returned to the old way of developing microservices based on SDK, and the advantages of service meshes have been lost. Can it still be called service mesh? In fact, this is also a compromise on performance—if you mainly use gRPC to develop microservices, you only need to maintain gRPC versions in different languages; that is, you can manage microservices through the control plane.\n\n\u003e *Envoy xDS has become the de facto standard for communication between cloud-native application services.*\n\n### Optimizing traffic hijacking with eBPF\n\nIn the section on transparent traffic hijacking, we can see the iptables rules and paths that an inter-service traffic passes through when it reaches the destination pod, which needs to go through multiple iptables rules, such as \u0060PREROUTING\u0060, \u0060ISTIO_INBOUND\u0060, \u0060ISTIO_IN_REDIRECT\u0060, \u0060OUTPUT\u0060, \u0060ISTIO_OUTPUT\u0060, and so on. Suppose now that there is a service A that wants to call service B in another pod on a non-localhost through the network stack, as shown in the figure below.\n\n![Service request path between pods not on the same host (iptables mode)](iptables-process.svg)\n\nFrom the figure, we can see that there are four iptables passes in the whole calling process. Among them, the outbound (iptables2) from Envoy in Pod A and the inbound (iptables3) from eth0 in Pod B are unavoidable. So can the remaining two, iptables1 and iptables4 be optimized? Wouldn\u0027t it be possible to shorten the network path by letting the two sockets communicate directly? This requires programming through eBPF such that:\n\n- Service A\u0027s traffic is sent directly to Envoy\u0027s inbound socket.\n- After Envoy in Pod B receives the inbound traffic, it has determined that the traffic is to be sent to the local service and directly connects the outbound socket to Service B.\n\nThe transparent traffic interception network path using eBPF mode is shown in the following figure.\n\n![Service request path between pods not on the same host (eBPF mode)](ebpf-diff-node.svg)\n\nIf service A and service B to be accessed are on the same node, the network path will be shorter.\n\n![Network request path between the same host Pod (eBPF mode)](ebpf-same-node.svg)\n\nAccess between services in the same node completely bypasses the TCP\/IP stack and becomes direct access between sockets.\n\n{{\u003ccallout note \u0022What is eBPF?\u0022\u003e}}\n\nWe know that modifying the Linux kernel code is difficult, and it takes a long time for new features to be released into the kernel. eBPF is a framework that allows users to load and run custom programs within the operating system\u0027s kernel. That is, with eBPF, you can extend and change the behavior of the kernel without directly modifying the kernel. I will briefly introduce eBPF to you below.\n\n- After the eBPF program is loaded into the kernel, it needs to pass the verification of the verifier before it can run. The verifier can prevent the eBPF program from accessing beyond its authority, ensuring the kernel\u0027s security.\n- eBPF programs are attached to kernel events and are triggered when there is an entry or exit from a kernel function.\n- In kernel space, eBPF programs must be written in a language that supports a compiler that generates eBPF byte code. Currently, you can write eBPF programs in C and Rust.\n- The eBPF program has compatibility issues with different Linux versions.\n\nSince the eBPF program can directly monitor and operate the Linux kernel, it has a perspective on the lowest level of the system and can play a role in traffic management, observability, and security.\n\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\nThe open source project [Merbridge](https:\/\/github.com\/merbridge\/merbridge) uses eBPF to shorten the path of transparent traffic hijacking and optimize the performance of the service mesh. For some details on the Merbridge implementation, please refer to the [Istio blog](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2022\/merbridge\/) .\n\n{{\u003ccallout warning Notice\u003e}}\nThe eBPF functions used by Merbridge require a Linux kernel version ≥ 5.7.\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\nAt first glance, eBPF seems to implement the functions of Istio at a lower level and has a greater tendency to replace sidecar. But eBPF also has many limitations that make it impossible to replace service meshes and sidecars in the foreseeable future. Removing the sidecar in favor of a proxy-per-host model would result in:\n\n1. The explosion radius of a proxy failure is expanded to the entire node.\n2. It makes the security problem more complicated because too many certificates are stored on a node. Once attacked, there will be a risk of key leakage.\n3. On the host, traffic contention between Pods.\n\nMoreover, eBPF is mainly responsible for Layer 3\/4 traffic and can run together with CNI, but it is not suitable to use eBPF for Layer 7 traffic.\n\n\u003e *In the near future, eBPF technology will not be able to replace service meshes and sidecars.*\n\n### Control plane performance optimization\n\nThe above two optimizations are carried out for the data plane. Let\u0027s look at the performance optimization of the control plane. You can think of a service mesh as a show, where the control plane is the director and the data plane is all the actors. The director is not involved in the show but directs the actors. If the plot of the show is simple and the duration is very short, then each actor will be allocated very few scenes, and rehearsal will be very easy; if it is a large-scale show, the number of actors is large and the plot is very complicated. To rehearse the show well, one director may not be enough. He can\u0027t direct so many actors, so we need multiple assistant directors (expanding the number of control plane instances); we also need to prepare lines and scripts for actors, if actors It is also possible to perform a series of lines and scenes in one shot (reduce the interruption of the data plane and push updates in batches), so is our rehearsal more efficient?\n\nFrom the above analogy, you should be able to find the direction of control plane performance optimization, that is:\n\n- Reduce the size of the configuration that needs to be pushed.\n- Push batch proxy.\n- To expand the scale of the control plane.\n\n#### Reduce the configuration that needs to be pushed out\n\nThe easiest and most straightforward way to optimize control plane performance is to reduce the size of the configuration to be pushed. Assuming that there is workload A, if the proxy configuration related to A, that is, the configuration of the service that A needs to access, is pushed to A, instead of pushing the configuration of all services in the mesh to A, it can greatly reduce the number of services to be pushed. The size and application range of the configuration. The Sidecar resource in Istio can help us do this. The following is an example of a sidecar configuration:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: networking.istio.io\/v1alpha3\nkind: Sidecar\nmetadata:\n  name: default\n  namespace: us-west-1\nspec:\n  workloadSelector:\n    labels:\n      app: app-a\n  egress:\n  - hosts:\n    - \u0022us-west-1\/*\u0022\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nWe can use the \u0060workloadSelector\u0060 field  to limit the scope of workloads that the sidecar configuration applies to, and the \u0060egress\u0060 field is used to determine the scope of services for the workload, so that the control plane can only push the configuration of its dependent services to service A, greatly reducing the need to push to the data plane. The configuration size of the service mesh reduces the memory and network consumption of the service mesh.\n\n#### Batch push the proxy configurations\n\nThe process of pushing the proxy configuration from the control plane Istiod to the data plane is complex. The following figure shows the process.\n\n![Flowchart of Istiod pushing proxy configuration to the data plane](istiod-push.svg)\n\nAfter an administrator configures the Istio mesh, the process for pushing proxy configuration in Istiod is as follows:\n\n1. The event that the administrator updates the configuration will trigger the configuration synchronization of the data plane.\n1. After listening to these events, Istio\u0027s \u0060DiscoveryServer\u0060 components will not push the configuration to the data plane immediately, but will add these events to the queue and continue to merge events within a period of time. This process is called debouncing, which is to prevent frequent updates to the data plane configuration.\n1. After the debouncing period, these events will be pushed to the queue.\n1. To expedite push progress, Istiod will limit the number of simultaneous push requests.\n1. Envoy configuration push data plane workloads are translated into events.\n\nFrom the above process, we can see that the key to optimizing configuration push is the debounce period in step 2 and the current limit setting in step 4. There are several environmental variables that can help you set up control plane push:\n\n- \u0060PILOT_DEBOUNCE_AFTER\u0060: The time after which the event will be added to the push queue.\n- \u0060PILOT_DEBOUNCE_MAX\u0060: This defines the maximum amount of time an event can debounce.\n- \u0060PILOT_ENABLE_EDS_DEBOUNCE\u0060: Specifies whether endpoint updates meet debounce rules or have priority and fall into the push queue immediately.\n- \u0060PILOT_PUSH_THROTTLE\u0060: Controls how many push requests are processed at once.\n\nPlease refer to the [Istio documentation](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/reference\/commands\/pilot-agent\/#envvars) for the default values and specific configuration of these environment variables .\n\nHow to set these values can follow the following principles:\n\n- If control plane resources are idle, to speed up the propagation of configuration updates, you can:\n  - Shorten the debounce period and increase the number of pushes.\n  - Increase the number of push requests processed simultaneously.\n- If the control plane is saturated, to reduce performance bottlenecks, you can:\n  - Delay the debounce cycle to reduce the number of pushes.\n  - Increase the number of push requests processed simultaneously.\n\nAs for how to set the optimal solution, you need to debug it in conjunction with your observable system.\n\n#### Scale up the control plane\n\nIf setting up debounce batch processing and sidecar cannot optimize the performance of the control plane, the final choice is to expand the scale of the control plane, including expanding the resources of a single Istiod instance and increasing the number of Istiod instances. Which expansion method is used depends on the situation:\n\n- When the resource occupancy of a single Istiod is saturated, it is recommended that you increase the instance size of Istiod. This is usually because there are too many resources in the service mesh (Istio\u0027s custom resources, such as VirtualService, DestinationRule, etc.) that need to be processed.\n- Then increase the number of instances of Istiod, which can spread the workloads to be managed by each instance.\n\n### Data plane performance optimization\n\nApache SkyWalking can serve as an observability tool for Istio and can also help us analyze the performance of services in dynamic debugging and troubleshooting. Its newly launched Apache SkyWalking Rover component can use eBPF technology to accurately locate Istio\u0027s key performance issues.\n\nOn the data plane, we can increase Envoy\u0027s throughput to optimize Istio\u0027s performance by:\n\n- Disable Zipkin tracing or reduce the sample rate.\n- Simplified access log format.\n- Disable Envoy\u0027s Access Log Service (ALS).\n\nFor data on the impact of the above optimizations on Envoy throughput, see Using eBPF to pinpoint key performance issues for service meshes.\n\n## Envoy: the service mesh\u0027s leading actor\n\nWe know that the service mesh is composed of the data plane and the control plane. From the above list of service mesh open source projects, we can see that most of the service mesh open source projects are based on Envoy, and then develop their own control plane. Remember when I likened a service mesh to a gig earlier in this article? In this service mesh performance, there is no way to think that Envoy is the leading actor. The xDS protocol, invented by Envoy, has basically become a general API for service meshes. Many open source projects for service meshes use Envoy as the data plane. Shown below is the architecture diagram of Envoy.\n\n![Envoy Architecture Diagram](envoy-arch.svg)\n\nxDS is the core that differentiates Envoy from other proxies because its code and parsing process are very complex and it is difficult to expand. The following is a topology diagram of Istio components. From the figure, we can see that there is not only one \u0060envoy\u0060 process but a \u0060pilot-agent\u0060.\n\n{{\u003cfigure title=\u0022Istio component topology\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 id=\u0022istio-components\u0022 src=\u0022istio-components.svg\u0022\u003e}}\n\nThe role of the \u0060pilot-agent\u0060 process is as follows:\n\n- As \u0060the\u0060 parent process of, responsible for the lifecycle management of Envoy.\n- Receive pushes from the control plane, configure the proxy and certificates.\n- Collect Envoy statistics and aggregate sidecar statistics for Prometheus to collect.\n- A built-in local DNS proxy is used to resolve the internal domain name of the cluster that cannot be resolved by Kubernetes DNS.\n- Health checks for Envoy and DNS proxy.\n\nFrom the above functions, we can see that the \u0060pilot-agent\u0060 process is mainly used to interact with Istiod and play a commanding and auxiliary role for Envoy. The core component of Istio is Envoy. So will Envoy \u0022act and guide,\u0022 no longer cooperate with Istio, and build its own control plane?\n\n\u003e *In a Sidecar container, the \u0060pilot-agent\u0060 is like Envoy\u0027s \u0022Sidecar\u0022.*\n\n{{\u003ccallout note \u0022Readers to think about\u0022\u003e}}\nCan the \u0060pilot-agent\u0060 function be built directly into Envoy, thus eliminating the \u0060pilot-agent\u0060?\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\n## Envoy Gateway unified service mesh gateway\n\nIn Kubernetes, the first resource object used to expose services in a cluster, in addition to the service resource object, is Ingress. Using Ingress you simply open an external access point for the cluster, routing traffic to specific services via HTTP Hosts and \u0060path\u0060. Compared with exposing services directly to service resources , it can reduce the network access point (PEP) of the cluster and reduce the risk of the cluster being attacked by the network. The following figure shows the process of using Ingress to access services in the cluster.\n\n![Kubernetes Ingress traffic access flow chart](ingress.svg)\n\nBefore Kubernetes, API Gateway software was widely used as edge routing. When referring to Istio, Istio\u0027s custom Gateway resources are added, which makes accessing resources in the Istio service mesh one more option, as shown in the following figure.\n\n![Ways to access services in the Istio mesh](access-cluster.svg)\n\nNow, to expose services in a single Istio mesh, how do I choose between \u0060NodePort\u0060, \u0060LoadBalancer\u0060, Istio Gateway, Kubernetes Ingress, and API Gateway software? If it is a multi-cluster service mesh, how do clients access services within the mesh? Our service mesh lead, Envoy, has done this well and is used in many forms:\n\n- Istio, Kuma, and Consul Connect all use Envoy as a sidecar proxy.\n- Kubernetes Ingress Controller\/API Gateway: [Contour](https:\/\/github.com\/projectcontour\/contour), [Emissary](https:\/\/github.com\/emissary-ingress\/emissary), [Hango](https:\/\/github.com\/hango-io\/hango-gateway), [Gloo](https:\/\/github.com\/solo-io\/gloo).\n\nThese projects utilize Envoy to implement service meshes and API gateways, with a lot of functional overlap, proprietary features, or a lack of community diversity due to the fact that the Envoy community does not provide a control plane implementation. In order to change the status quo, the Envoy community initiated the Envoy Gateway project, which will not change the Envoy core proxy, xDS, and go-control-plane. The project aims to combine the experience of existing Envoy-based API Gateway related projects. Some Envoy-specific extensions to the Kubernetes Gateway API lower the barrier to entry for Envoy users to use gateways. Because the Envoy Gateway still issues configuration to the Envoy proxy through xDS, you can also use it to manage gateways that support xDS, such as the Istio Gateway.\n\nThe gateways we have seen now are basically used as ingress gateways in a single cluster and can do nothing for multi-cluster and multi-mesh. To cope with multiple clusters, we need to add another layer of gateways on top of Istio and a global control plane to route traffic between multiple clusters, as shown in the figure below.\n\n![Schematic diagram of two-level gateway with multi-cluster and multi-mesh](t2-gateway.svg)\n\n{{\u003ccallout note \u0022A brief introduction to two-tire gateways\u0022\u003e}}\n- The Tire-1 gateway (hereinafter referred to as T1) is located at the application edge and is used in a multi-cluster environment. The same application is hosted on different clusters at the same time, and the T1 gateway routes the application\u0027s request traffic between these clusters.\n- The Tire-2 gateway (hereafter referred to as T2) is located at the edge of a cluster and is used to route traffic to services within that cluster managed by the service mesh.\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\nMulti-cluster service mesh management is achieved by adding a layer of global control plane and APIs in addition to the Istio control plane. Deploying T1 gateways as a cluster prevents a single point of failure. To learn more about two-tier gateways, refer [to Routing Service Mesh Traffic Through Two-Tier Gateway Designs](https:\/\/cloudnative.to\/blog\/designing-traffic-flow-via-tier1-and-tier2-ingress-gateways\/) .\n\nThe configuration of the T1 gateway is as follows:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: gateway.tsb.tetrate.io\/v2\nkind: Tier1Gateway\nmetadata:\n  name: service1-tier1\n  group: demo-gw-group\n  organization: demo-org\n  tenant: demo-tenant\n  workspace: demo-ws\nspec:\n  workloadSelector:\n    namespace: t1\n    labels:\n      app: gateway-t1\n      istio: ingressgateway\n  externalServers:\n  - name: service1\n    hostname: servicea.example.com\n    port: 80\n    tls: {}\n    clusters:\n    - name: cluster1\n      weight: 75\n    - name: cluster2\n      weight: 25 \n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThis configuration exposes \u0060servicea.example.com\u0060  service through the T1 gateway and forwards \u006075%\u0060 of the traffic accessing the service to cluster1 and \u006025%\u0060 of the traffic to cluster2. In addition, in order to deal with the traffic, services, and security configurations in multiple clusters, Tetrate\u0027s flagship product, [Tetrate Service Bridge](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/tetrate-service-bridge\/), a series of group APIs have also been added to the TSB documentation for details.\n\n## Istio open source ecosystem\n\nIstio has been open source for more than five years, and many open source projects have emerged in the past two years, among which the more representative ones are:\n\n- Slime (NetEase open source)\n- Tencent\u0027s open source initiatives Aeraki\n- Istio\u0027s official support for Wasm plugins\n\nTheir presence makes Istio more intelligent and expands the scope of Istio.\n\n### Slime\n\nSlime is an Istio-based smart mesh manager open-sourced by the NetEase Shufan microservices team. Slime has been implemented based on Kubernetes Operator and can be used as the CRD manager of Istio. It can define dynamic service governance policies without any customization of Istio, so as to achieve the purpose of automatically and conveniently using the high-level functions of Istio and Envoy.\n\nIn the previous control plane performance optimization, we mentioned optimizing the performance of Istio by \u0022reducing the configuration that needs to be pushed\u0022, but Istio cannot automatically identify and cannot rely on the proxy configuration that needs to be pushed to each sidecar to optimize. Slime provides a  \u0060lazyload\u0060 controller, which can help us implement lazy loading of configuration. Users do not need to configure the \u0060SidecarScope\u0060 manually. Istio can load service configuration and service discovery information on demand.\n\nThe following figure shows the flow chart of updating the data plane configuration with Slime as the management plane of Istio.\n\n![Flowchart for updating Istio data plane configuration using Slime](slime-process.svg)\n\nThe specific steps for updating the data plane configuration are as follows:\n\n1. The Slime Operator completes the initialization of Slime components in Kubernetes according to the administrator\u0027s configuration.\n2. Developers create configurations that conform to the Slime CRD specification and apply them to the Kubernetes cluster.\n3. Slime queries the monitoring data of related services saved in Prometheus, converts Slime CRD to Istio CRD in combination with the configuration of the adaptive part in Slime CRD, and pushes it to Global Proxy at the same time.\n4. Istio monitors the creation of Istio CRDs.\n5. Istio sends the Sidecar Proxy\u0027s configuration information to the corresponding Sidecar Proxy on the data plane.\n\nBecause the first invocation of all services in the data plane passes through the Global Proxy, the Proxy can record the invocation and dependency information of all services, and update the configuration of the Sidecar resource in Istio according to the dependency information. When the routing information is redefined, the original record of the Global Proxy becomes invalid, and a new data structure is required to maintain the calling relationship of the service. Slime created a  \u0060ServiceFence\u0060 to maintain the service invocation relationship and solve the problem of missing service information.\n\n### Aeraki\n\nAeraki Mesh is a service mesh project open sourced by Tencent Cloud in March 2021. It expands support for seven-layer protocols based on Istio and focuses on solving the service governance of **non-HTTP protocols** in Istio.  It entered the CNCF sandbox in June 2022.\n\nThe following figure shows the architectural diagram of Aeraki.\n\n![Aeraki Architecture Diagram](aeraki-arch.svg)\n\nThe process of using Aeraki to serve non-HTTP into an Istio mesh is as follows:\n\n1. Aeraki\u0027s X2Istio component connects to the service registry, obtains the registration information of non-HTTP services, and generates a ServiceEntry to register with Istio.\n2. Aeraki, as the management plane on top of Istio, obtains the ServiceEntry configuration from Istio.\n3. Aeraki judges the protocol type of the service (e.g. \u0060tcp-metaprotocol-dubbo\u0060) through the port command, then generates the MetaProtocol Proxy Filter (compatible with EnvoyFilter) configuration, and at the same time modifies the RDS address to point it to Aeraki.\n4. Istio uses the xDS protocol to deliver the configuration (LDS, CDS, EDS, etc.) to the data plane.\n5. Aeraki generates routing rules based on the information in the service registry and user settings and sends them to the data plane through RDS.\n\nThe key to the whole process of accessing non-HTTP services in Istio is the **MetaProtocol Proxy**. Istio supports HTTP\/HTTP2, TCP and gRPC protocols by default, and experimentally supports Mongo, MySQL and Redis protocols. To use Istio to route traffic for other protocols not only requires a lot of work to modify the Istio control plane and extend Envoy, but also a lot of duplication because different protocols share common control logic. The Envoy MetaProtocol Proxy is a general seven-layer protocol proxy implemented based on Envoy. The MetaProtocol Proxy is an extension based on the Envoy code. It implements basic capabilities such as service discovery, load balancing, RDS dynamic routing, traffic mirroring, fault injection, local\/global traffic limiting, etc. for the seven-layer protocol, which greatly reduces the difficulty of third-party protocol development for Envoy.\n\nThe following figure shows the architecture diagram of MetaProtocol Proxy.\n\n![MetaProtocol Proxy Architecture Diagram](metaprotocol-proxy.svg)\n\nWhen we want to extend Istio to support other seven-layer protocols such as Kafka, Dubbo, and Thrift, we only need to implement the codec interfaces (Decode and Encode) in the above figure, and then we can quickly develop a third-party protocol plug-in based on MetaProtocol. Because MetaProtocol Proxy is an extension of Envoy, you can still develop filters for it in different languages and use \u0060EnvoyFilter\u0060 resources to deliver configuration to the data plane.\n\n### WasmPlugin API\n\nWasmPlugin is an API introduced in Istio 1.12. As a proxy extension mechanism, we can use it to add custom and third-party Wasm modules to the data plane. The diagram below shows how a user can use the WasmPlugin in Istio.\n\n![Flowchart of using WasmPlugin in Istio](wasmplugin.svg)\n\nSpecific steps are as follows:\n\n1. Users use the Proxy-Wasm SDK (currently available in AssemblyScript, C\u002b\u002b, Rust, Zig, and Go) to develop extensions and build them into OCI images (such as Docker images) to upload to the mirror repository.\n2. The user writes the \u0060WasmPlugin\u0060 configuration and applies it to Istio.\n3. The \u0060WasmPlugin\u0060 configuration for the workload in the configuration is selected by the Istio control plane, and the Wasm module is injected into the specified Pod.\n4. The \u0060pilot-agent\u0060 in the sidecar loads the Wasm modules from remote or local files and run them in Envoy.\n\n## Who should use Istio?\n\nWell, having said that, what does this have to do with you? Istio\u0027s relationship with you depends on your role.\n\n- If you are the platform leader, after applying the service mesh, you may enhance the observability of your platform and have a unified platform to manage microservices. You will be the direct beneficiary and the main implementer of the service mesh.\n- If you are an application developer, you will also benefit from a service mesh because you can be more dedicated to the business logic and not worry about other non-functional issues such as retry policies, TLS, etc..\n\nThe following diagram shows the adoption path for service meshes.\n\n![The path to adopt service mesh](adopt.svg)\n\nWhether to adopt a service mesh depends on your technology development stage, whether the application implements containerization and microservices, the need for multi-language, whether mTLS is required, and the acceptance of performance loss.\n\n## Service mesh positioning in the cloud native technology stack\n\nThe development of technology is changing with each passing day. In the past two years, some new technologies have appeared, which seem to challenge the status of the service mesh. Some people claim that it can directly replace the existing service mesh of the classic sidecar model. We should not be confused by the noise of the outside world, correcting the positioning of service mesh in the cloud native technology stack.\n\n\u003e *Blindly promoting a technology and ignoring its applicable scenarios is hooliganism.*\n\nThe diagram below shows the cloud-native technology stack.\n\n![Cloud native technology stack diagram](cloud-native-stack.svg)\n\nWe can see that the \u0022cloud infrastructure\u0022, \u0022middleware\u0022, and \u0022application\u0022 layers in the cloud native technology stack diagram all enumerate some iconic open source projects that build standards in their fields:\n\n- In the field of cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes unifies the standards for container orchestration and application life cycle management, and the Operator mode lays the standards for extending the Kubernetes API and third-party application access.\n- In the field of middleware, the service mesh assumes some or all of the responsibilities of the seven-layer network, observability, and security in the cloud native technology stack. It runs in the lower layer of the application and is almost imperceptible; Dapr (distributed application runtime) defines the capability model of cloud-native middleware. Developers can integrate Dapr\u0027s multi-language SDK into their applications and programs for the distributed capabilities provided by Dapr, without caring about the applications running on them. environment and docking back-end infrastructure. Because the Dapr runtime (Sidecar mode deployment, which contains various building blocks) is running in the same Pod as the application, it automatically connects us with the backend components;\n- In the application field, OAM aims to establish an application model standard, an application through components, characteristics, policies, and workflows.\n\nThe diagram below shows how Istio is positioned for seven-tier mesh management in a cloud-native deployment.\n\n![Istio is positioned in a seven-layer network in a cloud-native architecture](istio-role.svg)\n\n{{\u003ccallout note \u0022What is the relationship between Dapr and Istio?\u0022\u003e}}\n\nSimilarities between Istio and Dapr:\n\n- Both Istio and Dapr can use the sidecar mode deployment model.\n- Both belong to middleware and can also manage communication between services.\n\nDifferences between Istio and Dapr:\n\n- Different goals: Istio\u0027s goal is to build a zero-trust network and define inter-service communication standards, while Dapr\u0027s goal is to build a standard API for middleware capabilities.\n- Different architectures: Istio = Envoy \u002b transparent traffic hijacking \u002b control plane; Dapr = multilingual SDK \u002b standardized API \u002b distributed capability components.\n- However, the application of Istio is almost imperceptible to developers and mainly requires the implementation of the infrastructure operation and maintenance team, while the application of Dapr requires developers to independently choose to integrate the Dapr SDK.\n\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\n## The future of service mesh\n\nIn the above article, I introduced the development context and open source ecosystem of Istio. Next, I will introduce the future trends of Istio service mesh:\n- Zero trust network\n- Hybrid cloud\n\n\u003e *The future of service meshes lies in being the infrastructure for zero-trust networks and hybrid clouds.*\n\nThis is also the direction of Tetrate, the enterprise-level service mesh provider of the author\u0027s company. We are committed to building an application-aware network suitable for any environment and any load and providing a zero-trust hybrid cloud platform. Shown below is the architecture diagram of Tetrate\u0027s flagship product, Tetrate Service Bridge.\n\n![TSB Architecture Diagram](tsb.svg)\n\nTetrate was founded by the founders of the Istio project, and TSB is based on open source Istio, Envoy, and Apache SkyWalking. We also actively contributed to the upstream community and participated in the creation of the Envoy Gateway project to simplify the use of Envoy gateways (XCP in the figure above is a gateway built with Envoy).\n\n## Zero trust\n\nZero Trust is an important topic at IstioCon 2022. Istio is becoming an important part of zero trust, the most important of which is **identity-oriented control** rather than network-oriented control.\n\n{{\u003ccallout note \u0022What is Zero Trust?\u0022\u003e}}\n\nZero Trust is a security philosophy, not a best practice that all security teams follow. The concept of zero trust was proposed to bring a more secure network to the cloud-native world. Zero trust is a theoretical state where all consumers within a network not only have no authority but also have no awareness of the surrounding network. The main challenges of zero trust are the increasingly granular authorization and time limit for user authorization.\n\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\n### Authentication\n\nIstio 1.14 adds support for SPIRE. SPIRE (SPIFFE Runtime Environment, CNCF Incubation Project) is an implementation of SPIFFE (Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone, CNCF Incubation Project). In Kubernetes, we use ServiceAccount to provide identity information for workloads in Pods, and its core is based on Token (using Secret resource storage) to represent workload identity. A token is a resource in a Kubernetes cluster. How to unify the identities of multiple clusters and workloads running in non-Kubernetes environments (such as virtual machines)? That\u0027s what SPIFFE is trying to solve.\n\nThe purpose of SPIFFE is to establish an open and unified workload identity standard based on the concept of zero trust, which helps to establish a fully identifiable data center network with zero trust. The core of SPIFFE is to define a short-lived encrypted identity document—SVID (SPFFE Verifiable Identity Document)—through a simple API, which is used as an identity document (based on an X.509 certificate or JWT token) for workload authentication. SPIRE can automatically rotate SVID certificates and keys according to administrator-defined policies, dynamically provide workload identities, and Istio can dynamically consume these workload identities through SPIRE.\n\nThe Kubernetes-based SPIRE architecture diagram is shown below.\n\n![Architecture diagram of SPIRE deployed in Kubernetes](spire-with-kubernetes.svg)\n\nIstio originally used the Citadel service in Istiod to be responsible for certificate management in the service mesh, and issued the certificate to the data plane through the xDS (to be precise, SDS API) protocol. With SPIRE, the work of certificate management is handed over to SPIRE Server. SPIRE also supports the Envoy SDS API. After we enable SPIRE in Istio, the traffic entering the workload pod will be authenticated once after being transparently intercepted into the sidecar. The purpose of authentication is to compare the identity of the workload with the environment information it runs on (node, Pod\u0027s ServiceAccount and Namespace, etc.) to prevent identity forgery. Please refer to How to Integrate SPIRE in Istio to learn how to use SPIRE for authentication in Istio.\n\nWe can deploy SPIRE in Kubernetes using the Kubernetes Workload Registrar, which automatically registers the workload in Kubernetes for us and generates an SVID. The registration machine is a Server-Agent architecture, which deploys a SPIRE Agent on each node, and the Agent communicates with the workload through a shared UNIX Domain Socket. The following diagram shows the process of using SPIRE for authentication in Istio.\n\n![Schematic diagram of the SPIRE-based workload authentication process in Istio\u0022](workload-attestation.svg)\n\nThe steps to using SPIRE for workload authentication in Istio are as follows:\n\n1. To obtain the SIVD, the SPIRE Agent is referred to as pilot-agent via shared UDS.\n1. The SPIRE Agent asks Kubernetes (to be precise, the kubelet on the node) for load information.\n1. The kubelet returns the information queried from the API server to the workload validator.\n1. The validator compares the result returned by the kubelet with the identity information shared by the sidecar. If it is the same, it returns the correct SVID cache to the workload. If it is different, the authentication fails.\n\nPlease refer to the SPIRE documentation for the detailed process of registering and authenticating workloads.\n\n### NGAC\n\nWhen each workload has an accurate identity, how can the permissions of these identities be restricted? RBAC is used by default in Kubernetes for access control. As the name suggests, this access control is based on roles. Although it is relatively simple to use, there is a role explosion problem for large-scale clusters—that is, there are too many roles, and the types are not static, making it difficult to track and audit role permission models. In addition, the access rights of roles in RBAC are fixed, and there is no provision for short-term use rights, nor does it take into account attributes such as location, time, or equipment. Enterprises using RBAC have difficulty meeting complex access control requirements to meet the regulatory requirements that other organizations demand.\n\nNGAC, or Next Generation Access Control, takes the approach of modeling access decision data as a graph. NGAC enables a systematic, policy-consistent approach to access control, granting or denying user management capabilities with a high level of granularity. NGAC was developed by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and is currently used for rights management in Tetrate Service Bridge. For more information on why you should choose NGAC over ABAC and RBAC, please refer to the blog post Why you should choose NGAC as your permission control model.\n\n## Hybrid cloud\n\nIn practical applications, we may deploy multiple Kubernetes clusters in various environments for reasons such as load balancing; isolation of development and production environments; decoupling of data processing and data storage; cross-cloud backup and disaster recovery; and avoiding vendor lock-in. The Kubernetes community provides a \u0022cluster federation\u0022 function that can help us create a multi-cluster architecture, such as the common Kubernetes multi-cluster architecture shown in the figure below, in which the host cluster serves as the control plane and has two member clusters, namely West and East.\n\n![Kubernetes Cluster Federation Architecture](multicluster.svg)\n\nCluster federation requires that the networks between the host cluster and member clusters can communicate with each other but does not require network connectivity between member clusters. The host cluster serves as the API entry, and all resource requests from the outside world to the host cluster will be forwarded to the member clusters. The control plane of the cluster federation is deployed in the host cluster, and the \u0022Push Reconciler\u0022 in it will propagate the identities, roles, and role bindings in the federation to all member clusters. Cluster federation simply \u0022connects\u0022 multiple clusters together, replicating workloads among multiple clusters, and the traffic between member clusters cannot be scheduled, nor can true multi-tenancy be achieved.\n\nCluster federation is not enough to realize hybrid clouds. In order to realize hybrid clouds in the true sense, it is necessary to achieve interconnection between clusters and realize multi-tenancy at the same time. TSB builds a general control plane for multi-cluster management on top of Istio and then adds a management plane to manage multi-clusters, providing functions such as multi-tenancy, management configuration, and observability. Below is a diagram of the multi-tenancy and API of the Istio management plane.\n\n![Schematic diagram of TSB\u0027s management plane built on top of Istio](tsb-management-plane.svg)\n\nIn order to manage the hybrid cloud, TSB built a management plane based on Istio, created tenant and workspace resources, and applied the gateway group, traffic group, and security group to the workloads in the corresponding cluster through selectors. For the detailed architecture of TSB, please refer to the [TSB documentation](https:\/\/docs.tetrate.io\/service-bridge).\n\nThanks for reading.\n', '\/en\/blog\/beyond-istio-oss\/')">

This article explains what SPIRE means for zero-trust architectures and why you would need SPIRE for authentication in Istio.\n\n## Authentication in Kubernetes\n\nWe all know that Istio was built for and typically runs on Kubernetes, so before we talk about how to use SPIRE for authentication in Istio, let’s take a look at how Kubernetes handles authentication.\n\nLet’s look at an example of a pod’s token. Whenever a pod gets created in Kubernetes, it gets assigned a default service account from the namespace, assuming we didn’t explicitly assign a service account to it. Here is an example:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\napiVersion: v1\ndata:\n  ca.crt: {CA_CRT}\n  namespace: ZGVmYXVsdA==\n  token: {TOKEN_STRING}\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io\/service-account.name: sleep\n    kubernetes.io\/service-account.uid: 2c0d00e8-13a2-48d0-9ff8-f987f3325ecf\n  creationTimestamp: \u00222022-06-14T03:01:35Z\u0022\n  name: sleep-token-gwhwd\n  namespace: default\n  resourceVersion: \u0022244535398\u0022\n  uid: b8822ceb-9553-4a17-96dc-d525bbaed0e0\ntype: kubernetes.io\/service-account-token\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nKubernetes manages the identity of Pods with Service Accounts and then specifies the permissions of Pods with a Service Account to the Kubernetes API using RBAC. A service account’s token is stored in a secret, which does not include a declaration of the node or pod where the workload is running. When a malicious actor steals a token, they gain full access to the account and can steal information or carry out sabotage under the guise of that user.\n\nA token can only be used to identify a workload in one cluster, but Istio supports multiple clusters and meshes, as well as Kubernetes environments and virtual machines. A unified workload identity standard can help here.\n\n## An Introduction to SPIFFE and SPIRE\n\nSPIFFE’s (Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone) goal is to create a zero-trust, fully-identified data center network by establishing an open, unified workload identity standard based on the concept of zero-trust. SPIRE can rotate X.509 SVID certificates and secret keys on a regular basis. Based on administrator-defined policies, SPIRE can dynamically provision workload certificates and Istio can consume them. I’ll go over some of the terms associated with SPIFFE in a little more detail below. \n\nSPIRE (SPIFFE Runtime Environment) is a SPIFFE implementation that is ready for production. SVID (SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document) is the document that a workload uses to prove its identity to a resource or caller. SVID contains a SPIFFE ID that represents the service’s identity. It uses an X.509 certificate or a JWT token to encode the SPIFFE ID in a cryptographically verifiable document. The SPIFFE ID is a URI that looks like this: \u0060spiffe:\/\/trust_domain\/workload_identifier\u0060.\n\n## SPIFFE and Zero Trust Security\n\nThe essence of Zero Trust is identity-centric dynamic access control. SPIFFE addresses the problem of identifying workloads.\n\nWe might identify a workload using an IP address and port in the era of virtual machines, but IP address-based identification is vulnerable to multiple services sharing an IP address, IP address forgery, and oversized access control lists. Because containers have a short lifecycle in the Kubernetes era, instead of an IP address, we rely on a pod or service name. However, different clouds and software platforms approach workload identity differently, and there are compatibility issues. This is especially true in heterogeneous hybrid clouds, where workloads run on both virtual machines and Kubernetes. It is critical to establish a fine-grained, interoperable identification system at this point.\n\n## Using SPIRE for Authentication in Istio\n\nWith the introduction of SPIRE to Istio, we can give each workload a unique identity, which is used by workloads in the service mesh for peer authentication, request authentication, and authorization policies. The SPIRE Agent issues SVIDs for workloads by communicating with a shared UNIX Domain Socket in the workload. The Envoy proxy and the SPIRE agent communicate through the Envoy SDS (Secret Discovery Service) API. Whenever an Envoy proxy needs to access secrets (certificates, keys, or anything else needed to do secure communication), it will talk to the SPIRE agent through Envoy’s SDS API.\n\nThe most significant advantage of SDS is the ease with which certificates can be managed. Without this feature, certificates would have to be created as a secret and then mounted into the agent container in a Kubernetes deployment. The secret must be updated, and the proxy container must be re-deployed if the certificate expires. Using SDS, Istio can push the certificates to all Envoy instances in the service mesh. If the certificate expires, the server only needs to push the new certificate to the Envoy instance; Envoy will use the new certificate right away, and the proxy container will not need to be re-deployed.\n\nThe architecture of using SPIRE for authentication in Istio is depicted in the diagram below.\n\n![SPIRE Architecture with Istio](spire-with-kubernetes.svg)\n\nUse StatefulSet resources to deploy the SPIRE Server and Kubernetes Workload Registrar in the spire namespace of the Kubernetes cluster, and DaemonSet resources to deploy a SPIRE Agent for each node. Assuming that you used the default DNS name \u0060cluster.local\u0060 when you install Kubernetes, [Kubernetes Workload Registrar](https:\/\/github.com\/spiffe\/spire\/blob\/main\/support\/k8s\/k8s-workload-registrar\/README.md) creates identities for the workloads in the Istio mesh in the following format:\n\n- SPRRE Server:\u0060spiffe:\/\/cluster.local\/ns\/spire\/sa\/server\u0060\n- SPIRE Agent:\u0060spiffe:\/\/cluster.local\/ns\/spire\/sa\/spire-agent\u0060\n- Kubernetes Node:\u0060spiffe:\/\/cluster.local\/k8s-workload-registrar\/demo-cluster\/node\/\u0060\n- Kubernetes Workload Pod:\u0060spiffe:\/\/cluster.local\/{namespace}\/spire\/sa\/{service_acount}\u0060\n\nThis way, both the nodes and each workload have their own globally unique identity and can be scaled according to the cluster (trust domain).\n\nThe workload authentication process in Istio mesh is shown in the figure below.\n\n![The workload authentication process in the Istio mesh](workload-attestation.svg)\n\nThe detailed process is as follows:\n\n1. The pilot-agent in the sidecar of the workload calls the SPIRE agent via the shared UDS to get the SVID.\n2. SPIRE Agent asks Kubernetes (kubelet on the node to be precise) for information about the workload.\n3. The kubelet returns the information queries from the Kubernetes API server to the workload attestor.\n4. The attestor compares the results returned by the kubelet with the identity information shared by the sidecar.\n5. If they match, returns the SVID to the workload and caches it, if not, the attestation failed.\n\nPlease refer to the [Istio documentation](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/ops\/integrations\/spire) to learn how to use SPIRE for authentication in Istio.\n\n## Summary\n\nSPIFFE unifies identity standards in heterogeneous environments, which is the foundation of zero-trust networks. In Istio, whether we use SPIRE or not, authentication is not perceptible to workloads. By using SPIRE to provide authentication for workloads, we can effectively manage workload identity and lay the foundation for a zero-trust network.\n', '\/en\/blog\/why-istio-need-spire\/')">

              <a href="#" onclick="exportToMarkdown('In-Depth Understanding of Istio: Announcing the Publication of a New Istio Book', 'By the Cloud Native Community(China)', '\n![](book.jpg)\n\nIt\u0027s been more than 5 years since Google, IBM, and Lyft unveiled the Istio open source project in May 2017. The Istio project has developed from a seed to a tall tree in these years. Many domestic books on the Istio service mesh were launched in the two years following the release of Istio 1.0 in 2018. My country is at the forefront of the world in the field of Istio book publishing.\n\n## Service mesh: one of the core technologies of cloud native\n\nToday, Istio is nearly synonymous with service mesh in China. The development of service mesh, as one of the core cloud-native technologies described by CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation), has gone through the following stages.\n\n- 2017-2018: Exploratory Phase\n- 2019-2020: Early Adopter Phase\n- 2021 to present: Implementation on a large scale and ecological development stage\n\nCloud native technology enables enterprises to design and deploy elastically scalable applications in new dynamic settings such as public, private, and hybrid clouds, according to the CNCF. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs are examples of cloud native technology.\n\nService mesh has been included to the CNCF definition of cloud native, indicating that it is one of the representative technologies of cloud native. Google is donating Istio to CNCF today, and we have reason to expect that as a CNCF project, Istio\u0027s community will be more open, and its future development will be more smooth.\n\n## Service mesh and cloud native applications\n\nCloud-native development is gaining traction. Despite the frequent emergence of new technologies and products, service mesh has maintained its place as \u0022cloud-native network infrastructure\u0022 as part of the overall cloud-native technology stack throughout the past year. The cloud-native technology stack model is depicted in the diagram below, with representative technologies for each layer to define the standard. Service mesh and other cloud-native technologies complement each other as a new era of middleware emerges. Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime) defines the cloud-native middleware capability model, OAM defines the cloud-native application model, and so on, whereas service mesh Lattice defines a cloud-native seven-layer network model.\n\n![Cloud Native Application Model](model.jpg)\n\n## Why you need a service mesh\n\nUsing a service mesh isn\u0027t tantamount to abandoning Kubernetes; it just makes sense. The goal of Kubernetes is to manage application lifecycles through declarative configuration, whereas the goal of service mesh is to provide traffic control, security management, and observability amongst apps. How do you set up load balancing and flow management for calls between services after a robust microservice platform has been developed with Kubernetes?\n\nMany open source tools, including Istio, Linkerd, MOSN, and others, support Envoy\u0027s xDS protocol. The specification of xDS is Envoy\u0027s most significant contribution to service mesh or cloud native. Many various usage cases, such as API gateways, sidecar proxies in service meshes, and edge proxies, are derived from Envoy, which is simply a network proxy, a modern version of the proxy configured through the API.\n\nIn a nutshell, the move from Kubernetes to Istio was made for the following reasons.\n\n- Application life cycle management, specifically application deployment and management, is at the heart of Kubernetes (scaling, automatic recovery, and release).\n- Kubernetes is a microservices deployment and management platform that is scalable and extremely elastic.\n- Transparent proxy is the cornerstone of service mesh, which intercepts communication between microservices via sidecar proxy and then regulates microservice behavior via control plane settings. The deployment mode of service meshes has introduced new issues today. For service meshes, sidecar is no longer required, and an agentless service mesh based on gRPC is also being tested.\n- xDS is a protocol standard for configuring service meshes, and a gRPC-based xDS is currently being developed.\n- Kubernetes traffic management is decoupled with the service mesh. The kube-proxy component is not required to support traffic within the service mesh. The traffic between services is controlled by an abstraction close to the microservice application layer to achieve security and observability features.\n- In Kubernetes, service mesh is an upper-level abstraction of service, and Serverless is the next stage, which is why Google released Knative based on Kubernetes and Istio following Istio.\n\n## Open source in the name of the community\n\nThe ServiceMesher community was founded in May 2018 with the help of Ant Financial. Following that, a tornado of service meshes erupted in China, and the community-led translation of Istio\u0027s official documentation reached a fever pitch.\n\nI became aware of a dearth of Chinese resources for systematically teaching Istio over time, so in September 2018, I began to plan and create an Istio book, launching the Istio Handbook open source e-book project on GitHub. I met many friends who are also interested in Istio and service mesh technology in the online and offline events of the community a few months later, with the promotion of service mesh technology and the expansion of the ServiceMesher community. We unanimously agreed to collaborate on an open source Istio e-book, which will compile the community\u0027s important writings and experience into a logical text and make it available to the majority of developers.\n\nHundreds of people volunteered and began co-authoring the book in March 2019 under the auspices of the Community Stewardship Council. In May 2020, we created a cloud-native community that incorporated the original ServiceMesher community in order to further promote cloud-native technology and expand the technical knowledge supplied by the community. The scope of community operations has also widened, moving away from service mesh to more extensive cloud-native tools.\n\nThe editorial board for this book, which includes me, Ma Ruofei, Wang Baiping, Wang Wei, Luo Guangming, Zhao Huabing, Zhong Hua, and Guo Xudong, was founded in October 2020. We performed further version updates, improvements, and optimizations to this book under the supervision and assistance of the publishing business. This book, \u0022In-depth Understanding of Isito: Advanced Practice of Cloud Native Service Mesh,\u0022 finally met you after many iterations.\n\n![The book cover](cover.jpg)\n\n## About this book\n\nAfter version 1.5, Istio underwent considerable architectural modifications, and various new or better features were added, including the addition of a smart DNS proxy, additional resource objects, increased support for virtual machines, and more.\n\nThis book is based on the new edition of Istio, and it aims to provide readers with the most up-to-date and comprehensive content possible by following the newest trends in the Istio community. Furthermore, several of the book\u0027s authors are front-line development or operation and maintenance engineers with extensive Istio expertise, offering detailed and useful reference cases for the book.\n\nThis book is currently available on the [JD.com](https:\/\/item.jd.com\/13200745.html). Please read \u0022In-depth Understanding of Isito: Advanced Practice of Cloud Native Service Mesh\u0022 if you want to learn more about Istio!\n', '\/en\/blog\/istio-service-mesh-book\/')">

              <a href="#" onclick="exportToMarkdown('Understanding the Sidecar Injection, Traffic Intercepting \u0026 Routing Process in Istio', 'Learn the sidecar pattern, transparent traffic intercepting and routing in Istio.', '\nBased on Istio version 1.13, this article will present the following.\n\n- What is the sidecar pattern and what advantages does it have?\n- How are the sidecar injections done in Istio?\n- How does the sidecar proxy do transparent traffic intercepting?\n- How is the traffic routed to upstream?\n\nThe figure below shows how the \u0060productpage\u0060 service requests access to \u0060http:\/\/reviews.default.svc.cluster.local:9080\/\u0060 and how the sidecar proxy inside the reviews service does traffic blocking and routing forwarding when traffic goes inside the \u0060reviews\u0060 service.\n\n![Istio transparent traffic intercepting and traffic routing diagram](istio-iptables.svg)\n\nAt the beginning of the first step, the sidecar in the \u0060productpage\u0060 pod has selected a pod of the reviews service to be requested via EDS, knows its IP address, and sends a TCP connection request.\n\nThere are three versions of the reviews service, each with an instance, and the sidecar work steps in the three versions are similar, as illustrated below only by the sidecar traffic forwarding step in one of the Pods.\n\n## Sidecar pattern\n\nDividing the functionality of an application into separate processes running in the same minimal scheduling unit (e.g. Pod in Kubernetes) can be considered sidecar mode. As shown in the figure below, the sidecar pattern allows you to add more features next to your application without additional third-party component configuration or modifications to the application code.\n\n![Sidecar pattern](sidecar-pattern.svg)\n\nThe Sidecar application is loosely coupled to the main application. It can shield the differences between different programming languages and unify the functions of microservices such as observability, monitoring, logging, configuration, circuit breaker, etc.\n\n### Advantages of using the Sidecar pattern\n\nWhen deploying a service mesh using the sidecar model, there is no need to run an agent on the node, but multiple copies of the same sidecar will run in the cluster. In the sidecar deployment model, a companion container (such as Envoy or MOSN) is deployed next to each application\u0027s container, which is called a sidecar container. The sidecar takes overall traffic in and out of the application container. In Kubernetes\u0027 Pod, a sidecar container is injected next to the original application container, and the two containers share storage, networking, and other resources.\n\nDue to its unique deployment architecture, the sidecar model offers the following advantages.\n\n- Abstracting functions unrelated to application business logic into a common infrastructure reduces the complexity of microservice code.\n- Reduce code duplication in microservices architectures because it is no longer necessary to write the same third-party component profiles and code.\n- The sidecar can be independently upgraded to reduce the coupling of application code to the underlying platform.\n\n## iptables manipulation analysis\n\nIn order to view the iptables configuration, we need to \u0060nsente\u0060r the sidecar container using the root user to view it, because \u0060kubectl\u0060 cannot use privileged mode to remotely manipulate the docker container, so we need to log on to the host where the \u0060productpage\u0060 pod is located.\n\nIf you use Kubernetes deployed by minikube, you can log directly into the minikube\u0027s virtual machine and switch to root. View the iptables configuration that lists all the rules for the NAT (Network Address Translation) table because the mode for redirecting inbound traffic to the sidecar is \u0060REDIRECT\u0060 in the parameters passed to the \u0060istio-iptables\u0060 when the Init container is selected for the startup, so there will only be NAT table specifications in the iptables and mangle table configurations if TPROXY is selected. See the iptables command for detailed usage.\n\nWe only look at the iptables rules related to \u0060productpage\u0060 below.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\n# login to minikube, change user to root\n$ minikube ssh\n$ sudo -i\n\n# See the processes in the productpage pod\u0027s istio-proxy container\n$ docker top \u0060docker ps|grep \u0022istio-proxy_productpage\u0022|cut -d \u0022 \u0022 -f1\u0060\nUID                 PID                 PPID                C                   STIME               TTY                 TIME                CMD\n1337                10576               10517               0                   08:09               ?

Where rules 5, 6, and 7 are extensions of the application of rules 2, 3, and 4 respectively (from UID to GID), which serve similar purposes and will be explained together. Note that the rules therein are executed in order, meaning that the rule with the next highest order will be used as the default. When the outbound NIC (out) is lo (local loopback address, loopback interface), it means that the destination of the traffic is the local Pod, and traffic sent from the Pod to the outside, will not go through this interface. Only rules 4, 7, 8, and 9 apply to all outbound traffic from the review Pod.\n\n**Rule 1**\n\n- Purpose: To pass through traffic sent by the Envoy proxy to the local application container, so that it bypasses the Envoy proxy and goes directly to the application container.\n- Corresponds to steps 6 through 7 in the illustration.\n- Details: This rule causes all requests from 127.0.0.6 (this IP address will be explained below) to jump out of the chain, return to the point of invocation of iptables (i.e. OUTPUT) and continue with the rest of the routing rules, i.e. the \u0060POSTROUTING\u0060 rule, which sends traffic to an arbitrary destination, such as the application container within the local Pod. Without this rule, traffic from the Envoy proxy within the Pod to the Pod container will execute the next rule, rule 2, and the traffic will enter the Inbound Handler again, creating a dead loop. Putting this rule in the first place can avoid the problem of traffic dead-ending in the Inbound Handler.\n\n**Rule 2, 5**\n\n- Purpose: Handle inbound traffic (traffic inside the Pod) from the Envoy proxy, but not requests to the localhost, and forward it to the Envoy proxy\u0027s Inbound Handler via a subsequent rule. This rule applies to scenarios where the Pod invokes its own IP address, i.e., traffic between services within the Pod.\n- Details: If the destination of the traffic is not localhost and the packet is sent by 1337 UID (i.e. istio-proxy user, Envoy proxy), the traffic will be forwarded to Envoy\u0027s Inbound Handler through \u0060ISTIO_IN_REDIRECT\u0060 eventually.\n\n**Rule 3, 6**\n\n- Purpose: To pass through the internal traffic of the application container within the Pod. This rule applies to traffic within the container. For example, access to Pod IP or localhost within a Pod.\n- Corresponds to steps 6 through 7 in the illustration.\n- Details: If the traffic is not sent by an Envoy user, then jump out of the chain and return to \u0060OUTPUT\u0060 to call \u0060POSTROUTING\u0060 and go straight to the destination.\n\n**Rule 4, 7**\n\n- Purpose: To pass through outbound requests sent by Envoy proxy.\n- Corresponds to steps 14 through 15 in the illustration.\n- Details: If the request was made by the Envoy proxy, return \u0060OUTPUT\u0060 to continue invoking the \u0060POSTROUTING\u0060 rule and eventually access the destination directly.\n\n**Rule 8**\n\n- Purpose: Passes requests from within the Pod to the localhost.\n- Details: If the destination of the request is localhost, return \u0060OUTPUT\u0060 and call \u0060POSTROUTING\u0060 to access localhost directly.\n\n**Rule 9**\n\n- Purpose: All other traffic will be forwarded to \u0060ISTIO_REDIRECT\u0060 after finally reaching the Outbound Handler of Envoy proxy.\n- Corresponds to steps 10 through 11 in the illustration.\n\nThe above rule avoids dead loops in the iptables rules for Envoy proxy to application routing, and guarantees that traffic can be routed correctly to the Envoy proxy, and that real outbound requests can be made.\n\n**About RETURN target**\n\nYou may notice that there are many \u0060RETURN\u0060 targets in the above rules, which means that when this rule is specified, it jumps out of the rule chain, returns to the call point of iptables (in our case \u0060OUTPUT\u0060) and continues to execute the rest of the routing rules, in our case the \u0060POSTROUTING\u0060 rule, which sends traffic to any destination address, you can think of This is intuitively understood as pass-through.\n\n**About the 127.0.0.6 IP address**\n\nThe IP 127.0.0.6 is the default \u0060InboundPassthroughClusterIpv4\u0060 in Istio and is specified in the code of Istio. This is the IP address to which traffic is bound after entering the Envoy proxy, and serves to allow Outbound traffic to be re-sent to the application container in the Pod, i.e. Passthought, bypassing the Outbound Handler. this traffic is access to the Pod itself, and not real outbound traffic. See Istio [Issue-29603](https:\/\/github.com\/istio\/istio\/issues\/29603) for more information on why this IP was chosen as the traffic passthrough.\n\n## The traffic routing process explained\n\nTraffic routing is divided into two processes, Inbound and Outbound, which will be analyzed in detail for the reader below based on the example above and the configuration of the sidecar.\n\n### Understand Inbound Handler\n\nThe role of the Inbound handler is to pass traffic from the downstream blocked by iptables to the localhost and establish a connection to the application container within the Pod. Assuming the name of one of the Pods is \u0060reviews-v1-545db77b95-jkgv2\u0060, run \u0060istioctl proxy-config listener reviews-v1-545db77b95-jkgv2 --port 15006\u0060 to see which Listener is in that Pod.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060ini\nADDRESS PORT  MATCH                                                                                           DESTINATION\n0.0.0.0 15006 Addr: *:15006                                                                                   Non-HTTP\/Non-TCP\n0.0.0.0 15006 Trans: tls; App: istio-http\/1.0,istio-http\/1.1,istio-h2; Addr: 0.0.0.0\/0                        InboundPassthroughClusterIpv4\n0.0.0.0 15006 Trans: raw_buffer; App: http\/1.1,h2c; Addr: 0.0.0.0\/0                                           InboundPassthroughClusterIpv4\n0.0.0.0 15006 Trans: tls; App: TCP TLS; Addr: 0.0.0.0\/0                                                       InboundPassthroughClusterIpv4\n0.0.0.0 15006 Trans: raw_buffer; Addr: 0.0.0.0\/0                                                              InboundPassthroughClusterIpv4\n0.0.0.0 15006 Trans: tls; Addr: 0.0.0.0\/0                                                                     InboundPassthroughClusterIpv4\n0.0.0.0 15006 Trans: tls; App: istio,istio-peer-exchange,istio-http\/1.0,istio-http\/1.1,istio-h2; Addr: *:9080 Cluster: inbound|9080||\n0.0.0.0 15006 Trans: raw_buffer; Addr: *:9080                                                                 Cluster: inbound|9080||\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThe following lists the meanings of the fields in the above output.\n\n- ADDRESS: downstream address\n- PORT: The port the Envoy listener is listening on\n- MATCH: The transport protocol used by the request or the matching downstream address\n- DESTINATION: Route destination\n\nThe Iptables in the reviews Pod intercept inbound traffic to port 15006, and from the above output we can see that Envoy\u0027s Inbound Handler is listening on port 15006, and requests to port 9080 destined for any IP will be routed to the \u0060inbound|9080||\u0060 Cluster.\n\nAs you can see in the last two rows of the Pod\u0027s Listener list, the Listener for \u00600.0.0.0:15006\/TCP\u0060 (whose actual name is \u0060virtualInbound\u0060) listens for all Inbound traffic, which contains matching rules, and traffic to port 9080 from any IP will be routed.

of the Outbound handler is to intercept traffic from the local application to which iptables has intercepted, and determine how to route it to the upstream via the sidecar.\n\nRequests from application containers are Outbound traffic, intercepted by iptables and transferred to the Outbound handler for processing, which then passes through the virtualOutbound Listener, the \u00600.0.0.0_9080\u0060 Listener, and then finds the upstream cluster via Route 9080, which in turn finds the Endpoint via EDS to perform the routing action.\n\n**Route

The sidecar mode and traffic transparent intercepting are the features and basic functions of Istio service mesh, understanding the process behind this function and the implementation details will help you understand the principle of service mesh and the content in the later chapters of the Istio Handbook, so I hope readers can try it from scratch in their own environment to deepen their understanding.\n\nUsing iptables for traffic intercepting is just one of the ways to do traffic intercepting in the data plane of a service mesh, and there are many more traffic intercepting scenarios, quoted below from the description of the traffic intercepting section given in the MOSN official network of the cloud-native network proxy.\n\n### Problems with using iptables for traffic intercepting\n\nCurrently, Istio uses iptables for transparent intercepting and there are three main problems.\n\n1. The need to use the conntrack module for connection tracking, in the case of a large number of connections, will cause a large consumption and may cause the track table to be full, in order to avoid this problem, the industry has a practice of closing conntrack.\n2. iptables is a common module with global effect and cannot explicitly prohibit associated changes, which is less controllable.\n3. iptables redirect traffic is essentially exchanging data via a loopback. The outbound traffic will traverse the protocol stack twice and lose forwarding performance in a large concurrency scenario.\n\nSeveral of the above problems are not present in all scenarios, let\u0027s say some scenarios where the number of connections is not large and the NAT table is not used, iptables is a simple solution that meets the requirements. In order to adapt to a wider range of scenarios, transparent intercepting needs to address all three of these issues.\n\n### Transparent intercepting optimization\n\nIn order to optimize the performance of transparent traffic intercepting in Istio, the following solutions have been proposed by the industry.\n\n**Traffic intercepting with eBPF using the Merbridge Open Source Project**\n\n[Merbridge](https:\/\/github.com\/merbridge\/merbridge) is a plug-in that leverages eBPF to accelerate the Istio service mesh, which was open sourced by DaoCloud in early 2022. Using Merbridge can optimize network performance in the data plane to some extent.\n\nMerbridge leverages the sockops and \u0060redir\u0060 capabilities of eBPF to transfer packets directly from inbound sockets to outbound sockets. eBPF provides the \u0060bpf_msg_redirect_hash\u0060 function to forward application packets directly.\n\n**Handling inbound traffic with tproxy**\n\ntproxy can be used for redirection of inbound traffic without changing the destination IP\/port in the packet, without performing connection tracking, and without the problem of conntrack modules creating a large number of connections. Restricted to the kernel version, tproxy\u0027s application to outbound is flawed. Istio currently supports handling inbound traffic via tproxy.\n\n**Use hook connect to handle outbound traffic**\n\nIn order to adapt to more application scenarios, the outbound direction is implemented by hook connect, which is implemented as follows.\n\n![Hook Connect Diagram](hook-connect.svg)\n\nWhichever transparent intercepting scheme is used, the problem of obtaining the real destination IP\/port needs to be solved, using the iptables scheme through getsockopt, \u0060tproxy\u0060 can read the destination address directly, by modifying the call interface, hook connect scheme reads in a similar way to tproxy.\n\nAfter the transparent intercepting, the  \u0060sockmap\u0060 can shorten the packet traversal path and improve forwarding performance in the outbound direction, provided that the kernel version meets the requirements (4.16 and above).\n\n## References\n\n- [Debugging Envoy and Istiod - istio.io](https:\/\/istio.io\/docs\/ops\/diagnostic-tools\/proxy-cmd\/)\n- [Demystifying Istio\u0027s Sidecar Injection Model - istio.io](https:\/\/istio.io\/blog\/2019\/data-plane-setup\/)\n- The traffic intercepting solution when MOSN is used as a sidecar - mosn.io\n', '\/en\/blog\/sidecar-injection-iptables-and-traffic-routing\/')">

Kubernetes needs to know the Istio cluster to which the sidecar to be injected is connected and its configuration.\n2. Kubernetes needs to know the configuration of the sidecar container itself to be injected, such as the image address, boot parameters, etc.\n3. Kubernetes injects the above configuration into the side of the application container by the sidecar injection template and the configuration parameters of the above configuration-filled sidecar.\n\nThe sidecar can be injected manually using the following command.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nistioctl kube-inject -f ${YAML_FILE} | kuebectl apply -f -\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThis command is injected using Istio\u0027s built-in sidecar configuration, see the [Istio official website](https:\/\/istio.io) for details on how to use Istio below.\n\nWhen the injection is complete you will see that Istio has injected initContainer and sidecar proxy-related configurations into the original pod template.\n\n### Init container\n\nThe Init container is a dedicated container that runs before the application container is launched and is used to contain some utilities or installation scripts that do not exist in the application image.\n\nMultiple Init containers can be specified in a Pod, and if more than one is specified, the Init containers will run sequentially. The next Init container can only be run if the previous Init container must run successfully. Kubernetes only initializes the Pod and runs the application container when all the Init containers have been run.\n\nThe Init container uses Linux Namespace, so it has a different view of the file system than the application container. As a result, they can have access to Secret in a way that application containers cannot.\n\nDuring Pod startup, the Init container starts sequentially after the network and data volumes are initialized. Each container must be successfully exited before the next container can be started. If exiting due to an error will result in a container startup failure, it will retry according to the policy specified in the Pod\u0027s restartPolicy. However, if the Pod\u0027s restartPolicy is set to Always, the restartPolicy is used when the Init container failed.\n\nThe Pod will not become Ready until all Init containers are successful. The ports of the Init containers will not be aggregated in the Service. The Pod that is being initialized is in the Pending state but should set the Initializing state to true. The Init container will automatically terminate once it is run.\n\n## Sidecar injection example analysis\n\nFor a detailed YAML configuration for the bookinfo applications, see \u0060bookinfo.yaml\u0060 for the official Istio YAML of productpage in the bookinfo sample.\n\nThe following will be explained in the following terms.\n\n- Injection of Sidecar containers\n- Creation of iptables rules\n- The detailed process of routing\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: apps\/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: productpage-v1\n  labels:\n    app: productpage\n    version: v1\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: productpage\n      version: v1\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: productpage\n        version: v1\n    spec:\n      serviceAccountName: bookinfo-productpage\n      containers:\n      -

For more information on how to use this command, visit \u0060tools\/istio-iptables\/pkg\/cmd\/root.go\u0060.\n\nThe significance of the container\u0027s existence is that it allows the sidecar agent to intercept all inbound and outbound traffic to the pod, redirect all inbound traffic to port 15006 (sidecar) except port 15090 (used by Prometheus) and port 15092 (Ingress Gateway), and then intercept outbound traffic from the application container which is processed by sidecar (listening through port 15001) and then outbound. See the [official Istio documentation](https:\/\/istio.io\/docs\/ops\/deployment\/requirements\/) for port usage in Istio.\n\n**Command analysis**\n\nHere is the purpose of this start-up command.\n\n- Forward all traffic from the application container to port 15006 of the sidecar.\n- Run with the \u0060istio-proxy\u0060 user identity, with a UID of 1337, the userspace where the sidecar is located, which is the default user used by the \u0060istio-proxy\u0060 container, see the runAsUser field of the YAML configuration.\n- Use the default REDIRECT mode to redirect traffic.\n- Redirect all outbound traffic to the sidecar proxy (via port 15001).\n\nBecause the Init container is automatically terminated after initialization, since we cannot log into the container to view the iptables information, the Init container initialization results are retained in the application container and sidecar container.\n\n## Pod Startup Sequence\n\nThe startup process of a Pod with Sidecar auto-injection enabled is as follows.\n\n1. The Init container starts first, injecting iptables rules into the Pod for transparent traffic interception. \n2. Subsequently, Kubernetes starts the containers in the order in which they are declared in the Pod Spec, but this is non-blocking and there is no guarantee that the first container will be started before the next one is started. \u0060istio-proxy\u0060 container starts, \u0060pilot-agent\u0060 will be the PID 1 process, which is the first process in the Linux user space and is responsible for pulling up other processes and handling zombie processes. The \u0060pilot-agent\u0060 generates the Envoy bootstrap configuration and fork the envoy process; the application container is started almost simultaneously with the \u0060istio-proxy\u0060 container, and the readiness probe comes in handy to prevent the container inside the Pod from receiving outside traffic before it is ready to start. Kubernetes will perform a readiness check on port 15021 of the \u0060istio-proxy\u0060 container, and the \u0060kubelet\u0060 will not route traffic to the Pod until the \u0060isito-proxy\u0060 has finished booting.\n3. After the Pod is started, the \u0060pilot-agent\u0060 becomes a daemon that monitors the rest of the system and provides Envoy with Bootstrap configuration, certificates, health checks, configuration hot reloading, identity support, and process lifecycle management, among other things.\n\n## Pod container startup order problem\n\nIn the process of Pod startup there is a container startup order problem. Suppose the following situation, the application container starts first and requests other services, when the \u0060istio-proxy\u0060 container has not finished starting, then the request will fail, and if your application is not robust enough, it may even cause the application container to crash and the Pod to restart. The solution for this situation is to\n\n- Modify the application to add timeout retries.\n- Increase the start delay of the process in the application container, for example by increasing the sleep time.\n- Add a [postStart](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/tasks\/configure-pod-container\/attach-handler-lifecycle-event\/) configuration to the application container to detect if the application process has finished starting, and Kubernetes will only mark the Pod\u0027s state as \u0060Running\u0060 if the detection is successful.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis article walks you through the process of starting Pods in the Istio data plane, and the issues that arise because of the order in which Pod contenters are started.\n', '\/en\/blog\/istio-pod-process-lifecycle\/')">

              <a href="#" onclick="exportToMarkdown('Istio Component Ports and Functions in Details', 'This article will introduce you to the various ports and functions of the Istio control plane and data plane.', '\nIn my last two blogs:\n\n- [Sidecar injection, transparent traffic hijacking , and routing process in Istio explained in detail](\/en\/blog\/sidecar-injection-iptables-and-traffic-routing\/)\n- [Traffic types and iptables rules in Istio sidecar explained](\/en\/blog\/istio-sidecar-traffic-types\/)\n\nI gave you a detailed overview of the traffic in the Istio data plane, but the data plane does not exist in isolation. This article will show you the ports and their usages for each component of both the control plane and data plane in Istio, which will help you understand the relationship between these flows and troubleshoot them.\n\n## Overview\n\nFirstly, I will show you a global schematic. The following figure shows the components of a sidecar in the Istio data plane, and the objects that interact with it.\n\n![Istio components](istio-ports-components.webp)\n\nWe can use the \u0060nsenter\u0060 command to enter the namespace of the \u0060productpage\u0060 Pod of the Bookinfo example and see the information about the ports it is listening on internally.\n\n![Istio sidecar ports](sidecar-ports.webp)\n\nFrom the figure, we can see that besides the port 9080 that the \u0060productpage\u0060 application listens to, the Sidecar container also listens to a large number of other ports, such as 15000, 15001, 15004, 15006, 15021, 15090, etc. You can learn about the ports used in Istio in the Istio documentation.\n\nLet\u0027s go back into the \u0060productpage\u0060 Pod and use the \u0060lsof -i\u0060 command to see the ports it has open, as shown in the following figure.\n\n![Productpage Pod ports](product-pod-ports.webp)\n\nWe can see that there is a TCP connection established between the \u0060pilot-agent\u0060 and \u0060istiod\u0060, the port in the listening described above, and the TCP connection established inside the Pod, which corresponds to the figure at the beginning of the article.\n\nThe root process of the Sidecar container (\u0060istio-proxy\u0060) is \u0060pilot-agent\u0060, and the startup command is shown below.\n\n![Internal procecces in Sidecar](sidecar-procecces.webp)\n\nAs we can see from the figure, the PID of its \u0060pilot-agent\u0060 process is 1, and it forked the Envoy process.\n\nCheck the ports it opens in Istiod, as shown in the figure below.\n\n![Istiod ports](sidecar-lsof.webp)\n\nWe can see the ports that are listened to, the inter-process and remote communication connections.\n\n## Ports usage overview\n\nThese ports can play a pivotal role when you are troubleshooting. They are described below according to the component and function in which the port is located.\n\n### Ports in Istiod\n\nThe ports in Istiod are relatively few and single-function.\n\n- 9876: ControlZ user interface, exposing information about Istiod\u0027s processes\n- 8080: Istiod debugging port, through which the configuration and status information of the grid can be queried\n- 15010: Exposes the xDS API and issues plain text certificates\n- 15012: Same functionality as port 15010, but uses TLS communication\n- 15014: Exposes control plane metrics to Prometheus\n- 15017: Sidecar injection and configuration validation port\n\n## Ports in sidecar\n\nFrom the above, we see that there are numerous ports in the sidecar.\n\n- 15000: Envoy admin interface, which you can use to query and modify the configuration of Envoy Proxy. Please refer to[ Envoy documentation](https:\/\/www.envoyproxy.io\/docs\/envoy\/latest\/operations\/admin) for details.\n- 15001: Used to handle outbound traffic.\n- 15004: Debug port (explained further below).\n- 15006: Used to handle inbound traffic.\n- 15020: Summarizes statistics, perform health checks on Envoy and DNS agents, and debugs \u0060pilot-agent\u0060 processes, as explained in detail below.\n- 15021: Used for sidecar health checks to determine if the injected Pod is ready to receive traffic. We set up the readiness probe on the \u0060\/healthz\/ready\u0060 path on this port, and Istio hands off the sidecar readiness checks to kubelet.\n- 15053: Local DNS proxy for scenarios where the cluster\u0027s internal domain names are not resolved by Kubernetes DNS.\n- 15090: Envoy Prometheus query port, through which the \u0060pilot-agent\u0060 will scratch metrics.\n\nThe above ports can be divided into the following categories.\n\n- Responsible for inter-process communication, such as 15001, 15006, 15053\n- Health check and information statistics, e.g. 150021, 15090\n- Debugging: 15000, 15004\n\nLet\u0027s look at the key ports in detail.\n\n## 15000\n\n15000 is Envoy\u0027s Admin interface, which allows us to modify Envoy and get a view and query metrics and configurations.\n\nThe Admin interface consists of a REST API with multiple endpoints and a simple user interface. You can enable the Envoy Admin interface view in the \u0060productpage\u0060 Pod using the following command:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl -n default port-forward deploy\/productpage-v1 15000\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nVisit \u0060http:\/\/localhost:15000\u0060 in your browser and you will see the Envoy Admin interface as shown below.\n\n![Envoy Admin interface](envoy-admin.webp)\n\n## 15004\n\nWith the \u0060pilot-agent\u0060 proxy \u0060istiod\u0060 debug endpoint on port 8080, you can access localhost\u0027s port 15004 in the data plane Pod to query the grid information, which has the same effect as port 8080 below.\n\n## 8080\n\nYou can also forward \u0060istiod\u0060 port 8080 locally by running the following command:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl -n istio-system port-forward deploy\/istiod 8080\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nVisit \u0060http:\/\/localhost:8080\/debug\u0060 in your browser and you will see the debug endpoint as shown in the figure below.\n\n![Pilot Debug Console](pilot-debug-console.webp)\n\nOf course, this is only one way to get the mesh information and debug the mesh, you can also use \u0060istioctl\u0060 command or Kiali to debug it, which will be more efficient and intuitive.\n\n## 15020\n\nPort 15020 has three main usages.\n\n1. Aggregating metrics: You can query port 15090 for Envoy\u0027s metrics, or you can configure it to query the application\u0027s metrics, aggregating Envoy, application, and its own metrics for Prometheus to collect. The corresponding debug endpoint is \u0060\/stats\/prometheus\u0060. \n2. Performing health checks on Envoy and DNS agent: the corresponding debug endpoints are \u0060\/healthz\/ready\u0060 and \u0060\/app-health\u0060.\n3. Debugging \u0060pilot-agent\u0060 processes: the corresponding debug endpoints are \u0060\/quitquitquit\u0060, \u0060debug\/ndsz\u0060 and \u0060\/debug\/pprof\u0060.\n\nThe following figure shows the debugging information you see when you open \u0060http:\/\/localhost:15020\/debug\/pprof\u0060 in your browser.\n\n![pprof endpoint](pprof.webp)\n\nThe information in the figure shows the stack information of the \u0060pilot-agent\u0060.\n\n## Summary\n\nBy understanding the component ports in Istio, you should have a better understanding of the relationship between the components in Istio and their internal traffic. Being familiar with the functions of these ports will help in troubleshooting the mesh.\n', '\/en\/blog\/istio-components-and-ports\/')">

This article will show you the six types of traffic and their iptables rules in Istio sidecar.\n\n## iptables Traffic Routing in Sidecar\n\nThe following list summarizes the six types of traffic in Sidecar.\n\n 1. Remote service accessing local service: Remote Pod -\u003e Local Pod\n 2. Local service accessing remote service: Local Pod -\u003e Remote Pod\n 3. Prometheus crawling metrics of local service: Prometheus -\u003e Local Pod\n 4. Traffic between Local Pod service: Local Pod -\u003e Local Pod\n 5. Inter-process TCP traffic within Envoy\n 6. Sidecar to Istiod traffic\n\nThe following will explain the iptables routing rules within Sidecar for each scenario, which specifies which rule in ISTIO_OUTPUT is used for routing.\n\n## Type 1: Remote Pod -\u003e Local Pod\n\nThe following are the iptables rules for remote services, applications or clients accessing the local pod IP of the data plane.\n\nRemote Pod -\u003e \u0060RREROUTING\u0060 -\u003e \u0060ISTIO_INBOUND\u0060 -\u003e \u0060ISTIO_IN_REDIRECT\u0060 -\u003e Envoy 15006 (Inbound) -\u003e \u0060OUTPUT\u0060 -\u003e **\u0060ISTIO_OUTPUT\u0060 RULE 1** -\u003e \u0060 POSTROUTING\u0060 -\u003e Local Pod\n\nWe see that the traffic only passes through the Envoy 15006 Inbound port once. The following diagram shows this scenario of the iptables rules.\n\n![Remote Pod to Local Pod](remote-pod-local-pod.svg)\n\n## Type 2: Local Pod -\u003e Remote Pod\n\nThe following are the iptables rules that the local pod IP goes through to access the remote service.\n\nLocal Pod-\u003e \u0060OUTPUT\u0060 -\u003e **\u0060ISTIO_OUTPUT\u0060 RULE 9** -\u003e \u0060ISTIO_REDIRECT\u0060 -\u003e Envoy 15001 (Outbound) -\u003e \u0060OUTPUT\u0060 -\u003e **\u0060ISTIO_OUTPUT\u0060 RULE 4** -\u003e \u0060POSTROUTING\u0060 -\u003e Remote Pod\n\nWe see that the traffic only goes through the Envoy 15001 Outbound port. \n\n![Local Pod to Remote Pod](local-pod-remote-pod.svg)\n\nThe traffic in both scenarios above passes through Envoy only once because only one scenario occurs in that Pod, sending or receiving requests.\n\n## Type 3: Prometheus -\u003e Local Pod\n\nPrometheus traffic that grabs data plane metrics does not have to go through the Envoy proxy.\n\nThese traffic pass through the following iptables rules.\n\nPrometheus-\u003e \u0060RREROUTING\u0060 -\u003e \u0060ISTIO_INBOUND\u0060 (traffic destined for ports 15020, 15090 will go to \u0060INPUT\u0060) -\u003e \u0060INPUT\u0060  -\u003e Local Pod\n\n![Prometheus to Local Pod](prometheus-local-pod.svg)\n\n## Type 4: Local Pod -\u003e Local Pod\n\nA Pod may simultaneously have two or more services. If the Local Pod accesses a service on the current Pod, the traffic will go through Envoy 15001 and Envoy 15006 ports to reach the service port of the Local Pod.\n\nThe iptables rules for this traffic are as follows.\n\nLocal Pod-\u003e \u0060OUTPUT\u0060 -\u003e **\u0060ISTIO_OUTPUT\u0060 RULE 9** -\u003e \u0060ISTIO_REDIRECT\u0060 -\u003e Envoy 15001（Outbound）-\u003e \u0060OUTPUT\u0060 -\u003e **\u0060ISTIO_OUTPUT\u0060 RULE 2** -\u003e \u0060ISTIO_IN_REDIRECT\u0060 -\u003e Envoy 15006（Inbound）-\u003e \u0060OUTPUT\u0060 -\u003e **\u0060ISTIO_OUTPUT\u0060 RULE 1** -\u003e \u0060POSTROUTING\u0060 -\u003e Local Pod\n\n![Local Pod to Local Pod](local-pod-local-pod.svg)\n\n## Type 5: Inter-process TCP traffic within Envoy\n\nEnvoy internal processes with UID and GID 1337 will communicate with each other using lo NICs and localhost domains.\n\nThe iptables rules that these flows pass through are as follows.\n\nEnvoy process (Localhost) -\u003e \u0060OUTPUT\u0060 -\u003e **\u0060ISTIO_OUTPUT\u0060 RULE 8** -\u003e \u0060POSTROUTING\u0060 -\u003e Envoy process (Localhost)\n\n![Envoy inter-process TCP traffic](envoy-internal-tcp-traffic.svg)\n\n## Type 6: Sidecar to Istiod traffic\n\nSidecar needs access to Istiod to synchronize its configuration so that Envoy will have traffic sent to Istiod.\n\nThe iptables rules that this traffic passes through are as follows.\n\n\u0060pilot-agent\u0060 process -\u003e \u0060OUTPUT\u0060 -\u003e **\u0060Istio_OUTPUT\u0060 RULE 9** -\u003e Envoy 15001 (Outbound Handler) -\u003e OUTPUT -\u003e **\u0060ISTIO_OUTPUT\u0060 RULE 4** -\u003e \u0060POSTROUTING\u0060  -\u003e Istiod\n\n![Sidecar to Istiod](sidecar-istiod.svg)\n\n## Summary\n\nAll the sidecar proxies that Istio injects into the Pod or installed in the virtual machine form the data plane of the service mesh, which is also the main workload location of Istio. In my next blog, I will take you through the ports of each component in Envoy and their functions, so that we can have a more comprehensive understanding of the traffic in Istio.\n', '\/en\/blog\/istio-sidecar-traffic-types\/')">
