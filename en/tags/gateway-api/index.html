As a participant and a panel moderator, I will share in this article the highlights of the conference and the in-depth discussions on service meshes and gateway technologies.\n\n![KubeCon China Scene](https:\/\/jimmysong.io\/img\/blog\/kubecon-china-2024-recap\/kubecon-china-2024-hall.webp)\n\n## Key Themes\n\nThis edition of KubeCon introduced a theme on AI and developers, here are some of the focal points:\n\n1. **Practical Applications of Cloud Native Technologies in Industries**: Especially in the electric vehicle and cybersecurity sectors, such as the joint discussion by Huawei and NIO on how cloud native technologies can accelerate innovation in electric vehicles.\n\n2. **The Power of the Kubernetes Community**: Detailed discussions on the influence of China\u0027s Kubernetes community and its role in advancing regional cloud native activities.\n\n3. **The Integration of Open Source Technology and Artificial Intelligence**: Discussions on the advanced position of China and Hong Kong in the fields of open source and AI technologies and how these are driving regional technological innovation and development.\n\n4. **Latest Developments in Service Meshes and API Gateways**: Including updates on service mesh technologies and how they work in conjunction with Kubernetes schedulers to enhance system throughput.\n\n5. **New Strategies for Supply Chain Security**: Focusing on the latest developments in securing supply chains, particularly practical guidelines on SLSA compliance.\n\n6. **Multicluster Management and Edge Computing**: Discussions on strategies for effective management and innovation across different architectures and systems.\n\n7. **Optimization of AI Large Model Inference Performance**: Discussion on performance acceleration in serverless architectures for AI large model inference and related technological advancements.\n\n## Istio and Modern API Gateways: Exploring the Future of Service Meshes\n\nIn a [roundtable discussion](https:\/\/kccncossaidevchn2024.sched.com\/event\/1eYY6\/istio-and-modern-api-gateways-navigating-the-future-of-service-meshes-istiorejiong-apijie-daepqiu-jie-zha-jimmy-song-jianpeng-he-tetrate-jiaqi-zhang-alibaba-cloud-jintao-zhang-kong-inc-xunzhuo-liu-tencent) that I participated in with industry leaders from Tetrate, Alibaba Cloud, and Kong Inc., we delved deeply into the latest developments and integrations of Istio and API gateways.\n\n![KubeCon China 2024 Istio and Modern API Gateways Panel](https:\/\/jimmysong.io\/img\/blog\/kubecon-china-2024-recap\/kubecon-china-2024-panel.webp)\n\n1. **Innovations in Istio**: We discussed the latest version update of Istio (Istio 1.123) and key features such as optimizations in the Ambient mode, a new architectural choice that reduces resource consumption while enhancing performance.\n\n2. **Practical Comparison Between Ambient and Sidecar Modes**:\n   - **When to Choose Sidecar**: When high isolation and detailed traffic management are required.\n   - **When to Choose Ambient**: When pursuing ultimate performance and resource efficiency.\n\n3. **Challenges in the Development of Ambient Mode**: Despite its advantages, Ambient mode still faces challenges in complex traffic management and multi-tenant environments.\n\n4. **Service Mesh Optimization Strategies**: Discussing methods to enhance the performance and efficiency of cloud applications through service mesh improvements.\n\n5. **Integration of Service Meshes and API Gateways**: Demonstrating how these two technologies work together to support more complex deployment and operational modes.\n\n## Future Perspectives on Istio\n\nIn the [presentation by Zhonghu Xu and Jianpeng He](https:\/\/kccncossaidevchn2024.sched.com\/event\/1eYcG\/what-is-the-future-of-service-mesh-sidecar-or-sidecarless-jie-zha-dyagsyi-wu-pi-yi-wu-zhonghu-xu-huawei), we gained insights into the possible future directions of Istio:\n\n- **Dual Mode Drive**: Istio is likely to support both the Ambient mode and the traditional Sidecar mode simultaneously. Ambient mode suits users seeking performance and cost optimization, while the Sidecar mode will continue to support users requiring comprehensive functionalities.\n\n- **Support for Gateway API**: Istio\u0027s support for the Gateway API provides users with more flexible routing and policy configuration options.\n\n- **Application of Waypoints Strategies**: Waypoints need not be limited to Istio or Envoy. Using the Gateway API and GAMMA, any standard-compliant implementation can serve as a Waypoint, offering greater flexibility and scalability for service meshes.\n\n### Sandwich Waypoint\n\nThey emphasized the Sandwich Waypoint, which supports:\n\n- **Traffic Redirection**: By setting the \u0060istio.io\/use-waypoint: {namespace}\/{gateway-name}\u0060 annotation, traffic to a target service, pod, or within a namespace can be redirected to the same Waypoint.\n- **Waypoint Deployment**: Users can deploy a Waypoint by creating a Gateway object. Unlike the original implementation of Waypoint, the new deployment method will include associated services and service accounts, not just the Waypoint instance.\n- **Routing and Policy Configuration**: Using the Gateway API for routing and policy configuration provides more customization options for users and providers.\n\nThis represents a mode in Istio\u0027s Ambient mode for capturing layer 7 traffic, as illustrated below.\n\n![Sandwich Waypoint Traffic Capture](istio-ambient-traffic-capture.svg)\n\nThe steps for capturing layer 7 traffic with Istio Sandwich Waypoint are as follows:\n\n1. Terminate the HBONE connection via zTunnel, arriving at the Waypoint, with zTunnel responsible for decoding the HBONE protocol.\n2. Waypoint extracts destination addresses, source addresses, etc., to handle traffic and determine forwarding locations.\n3. Waypoint expands or parses the transport layer encapsulation (TLV) data, with proxies supporting TLV processing to provide additional context.\n4. Waypoint communicates with the peer zTunnel, coordinating with the server-side zTunnel to ensure correct traffic transfer.\n5. Encapsulate HBONE, sent by the server-side zTunnel to the final server destination, achieving fine-grained traffic management and routing in an Istio environment while maintaining compatibility with existing network protocols.\n\n## Cutting-Edge Extensions in Envoy Gateway\n\nIn a [presentation](https:\/\/kccncossaidevchn2024.sched.com\/event\/1eYcX\/gateway-api-and-beyond-introducing-envoy-gateways-gateway-api-extensions-jie-api-daeptao-envoyjie-zha-jie-api-huabing-zhao-tetrate) at KubeCon, Huabing Zhao discussed how Envoy Gateway enhances its capabilities and flexibility by extending the Kubernetes Gateway API, covering a wide range of matching and routing capabilities, new resource and policy models, and details of security policies.\n\n- **Gateway API Compatibility**: Envoy Gateway is fully compatible with the Gateway API and offers a wide range of matching and routing options. These include HTTP host and path matching, HTTP header-based operations, weighted load balancing, and support for gRPC, UDP, and TCP routing.\n- **Policies for Advanced Traffic Management:** The introduction of ClientTrafficPolicy and BackendTrafficPolicy provides users with more granular control over traffic management for both upstream and downstream connections, including features such as rate limiting, retries, load balancing, circuit breakers, and more.\n- **Enhancement of Security and Authentication**: The introduced SecurityPolicy supports CORS, HTTP basic authentication, OIDC, JWT authentication, and can integrate with various identity providers. It also provides detailed access control, allowing authorization based on the requester\u0027s original IP, JWT claims, etc.\n- **Expanding Functionality with Custom Extensions:** Envoy Gateway offers support for custom extensions through WASM (WebAssembly) and external process extensions. This allows users to enhance the gateway’s functionality by integrating their own customized extensions, tailored to specific use cases and operational needs.\n- **Future Exploration**: Future versions are expected to support non-Kubernetes environments deployment, optimize memory usage in the control plane, and expand authorization capabilities.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThrough this conference, we gained insights into Istio\u0027s Ambient mode and the developments in Envoy Gateway. The discussions on these technologies not only forecast future trends but also provided practical insights to facilitate the implementation and innovation of technologies.', '\/en\/blog\/kubecon-china-2024-recap\/')">

This article aims to explore the connections and differences between the Ingress API, Istio API, and Kubernetes Gateway API, detailing their selection and migration strategies in practical applications.\n\n## Introduction\n\nPreviously, I wrote an article discussing [Why the Gateway API Is the Unified Future of Ingress for Kubernetes and Service Mesh](\/en\/blog\/why-gateway-api-is-the-future-of-ingress-and-mesh\/). The article pointed out that as Kubernetes\u0027 original ingress gateway, Ingress\u0027s resource model is too simple to meet the demands of today\u0027s programmable networks. As its successor, the Gateway API has rapidly developed in recent years and has gained broad support, including many emerging open-source gateway projects like [Envoy Gateway](https:\/\/gateway.envoyproxy.io) choosing to develop based on the Gateway API. Additionally, some legacy gateway projects have started adapting to the Gateway API or using tools like [ingress2gateway](https:\/\/github.com\/kubernetes-sigs\/ingress2gateway) to migrate.\n\nThe Gateway API, as the latest achievement in Kubernetes ingress gateways, separates concerns through role division and supports cross-namespace capabilities, making it more suitable for multi-cloud environments. It integrates the overlapping functions of ingress gateways (north-south) and service meshes (east-west, intra-cluster routing) to provide a new reference model for unified traffic management in the cloud-native era.\n\nIngress API, Gateway API, and Istio API can all implement gateway functions, but what are the connections and differences between them? This article will unveil this mystery and provide strategies for selecting and migrating gateways in Kubernetes environments.\n\n## Kubernetes Traffic Management\n\nWith the widespread adoption and increasing complexity of microservice architectures, Kubernetes\u0027 traffic management tools have also evolved to meet various technical needs. The Ingress API, Istio API, and Kubernetes Gateway API each represent different stages of this evolution.\n\n**Ingress API** offers basic traffic management capabilities in Kubernetes, allowing users to manage external access to services within the cluster through simple routing rules (e.g., HTTP and HTTPS). Although its design is straightforward, its functionality is limited and mainly suitable for smaller-scale, less complex applications.\n\nIn contrast, **Istio API**, as part of a service mesh, offers a range of advanced traffic management features, such as traffic mirroring, canary releases, and circuit breakers, suitable for large-scale microservice architectures requiring complex traffic management.\n\nTo overcome the limitations of the Ingress API and integrate advanced features similar to those of Istio, the **Kubernetes Gateway API** was developed. It not only provides greater flexibility and extensibility in its design but also, through broad community support, serves as a bridge connecting traditional Ingress implementations and modern service mesh technologies like Istio, with most mainstream open-source gateways being based on or adapted to the Gateway API.\n\nThe following table summarizes the core features and recommended use cases for each API:\n\n| API Name      | Object Type                | Status                  | Recommended Use Cases                                       |\n| ------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Ingress API   | \u0060Ingress\u0060                  | Stable (Kubernetes v1.19)| Suitable for small-scale and simple scenarios, mainly for basic routing configurations |\n| Istio API     | \u0060VirtualService\u0060, \u0060Gateway\u0060| Stable (Istio 1.22)     | Suitable for highly complex microservice architectures, requiring fine-grained control and advanced traffic management features |\n| Gateway API   | \u0060HTTPRoute\u0060, \u0060Gateway\u0060     | Stable (Gateway API v1.1)| Suitable for new or existing deployments that require increased flexibility and scalability, especially when combined with Istio |\n\nThe launch of [Gateway API v1.1](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/blog\/2024\/05\/09\/gateway-api-v1-1\/), especially its improvements in compatibility with existing Ingress configurations, provides a smooth migration path for users, making the transition from traditional Ingress solutions to more modern, feature-rich Gateway API easier.\n\n## Migrating from Ingress to Kubernetes Gateway API\n\nTo migrate from Ingress to Gateway API, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Key Differences**: Compared to Ingress, the Gateway API introduces several new concepts and resource types, such as \u0060Gateway\u0060, \u0060HTTPRoute\u0060, and \u0060TLSRoute\u0060. These resources offer more configuration options and flexibility; refer to the [Gateway API documentation](https:\/\/gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io\/guides\/) for their configurations.\n2. **Configure Entry Points**: Create \u0060Gateway\u0060 resource configurations, clearly defining how to receive external traffic, including protocols, ports, and TLS terminations.\n3. **Map Old Resources**: Map existing Ingress resources to corresponding Gateway API resources. For example, host and path rules in Ingress need to be converted into route rules in HTTPRoute.\n4. **Test and Deploy**: Before officially migrating, test the new Gateway API configurations in a test environment to ensure all traffic routing is normal and there are no security vulnerabilities.\n\nTo simplify the migration process, you can use tools like [ingress2gateway](https:\/\/github.com\/kubernetes-sigs\/ingress2gateway), which can automatically convert Ingress configurations into Gateway API formats.\n\n## Practical Migration Example\n\nHere is a simple example of an HTTP gateway configuration demonstrating how to migrate from Ingress to the Gateway API.\n\nAssume you have an existing Ingress configuration as follows:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io\/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: example-ingress\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - host: example.com\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: \/\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          service:\n            name: example-service\n            port:\n              number: 80\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nTo migrate it to the Gateway API, first create a Gateway object:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io\/v1\nkind: Gateway\nmetadata:\n  name: example-gateway\nspec:\n  gatewayClassName: example-gateway-class\n  listeners:\n    - name: http\n      protocol: HTTP\n      port: 80\n      allowedRoutes:\n        kinds:\n          - kind: HTTPRoute\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nEnsure that the \u0060gatewayClassName\u0060 refers to a valid GatewayClass configured in your cluster. The GatewayClass is usually set by the cluster administrator and provides a resource to configure the Gateway.\n\nNext, create an HTTPRoute resource to define routing rules that route traffic to the backend service:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io\/v1\nkind: HTTPRoute\nmetadata:\n  name: example-httproute\nspec:\n  parentRefs:\n  - name: example-gateway\n  hostnames:\n  - \u0022example.com\u0022\n  rules:\n  - matches:\n    - path:\n        type: PathPrefix\n        value: \u0022\/\u0022\n    backendRefs:\n    - name: example-service\n      port: 80\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nIn this example, we see:\n\n- The rules from the \u0060Ingress\u0060 object are directly mapped to the \u0060HTTPRoute\u0060 object.\n- The hostname matching, path matching, and backend service configurations remain unchanged, but the object and field names differ.\n\n## Considerations and Challenges\n\nAlthough it is possible to migrate from Ingress to Gateway API and potentially run them simultaneously, there are several challenges and considerations for the necessity of migration:\n\n- **Feature Differences**: Certain features specific to some Ingress controllers may not have direct equivalents in the Gateway API, requiring additional configurations or custom resources to achieve similar functionalities.\n- **Multi-Resource Management**: Using the Gateway API may involve managing more resource types and complex configurations than Ingress, potentially increasing the complexity of administration.\n\nFor existing users of Ingress and Istio API, whether to migrate to the Gateway API depends on specific circumstances. Here are some migration recommendations:\n\n- **For New Deployments**: It is advisable to use the Gateway API directly to take advantage of its advanced features and anticipate future developments.\n- **For Existing Deployments**: If the existing system operates stably and does not require advanced features, you can continue using the current APIs. If you seek to leverage new features of the Gateway API or plan for long-term development, a gradual migration is a prudent choice.\n\nFor the support status of different gateways for the Gateway API, refer to the [Gateway API Implementation Conformance Report](https:\/\/gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io\/implementations\/v1.1\/) for more details.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Ingress API, Istio API, and Kubernetes Gateway API each have distinct features suitable for different application scenarios and needs. Selecting the appropriate API and planning and managing effectively can significantly enhance system flexibility and stability. As the Gateway API continues to develop and mature, it is increasingly becoming the mainstream choice for future traffic management.\n\nChoosing the right gateway technology, combined with your specific needs and existing architecture, can better manage and optimize traffic to ensure efficient and stable application operation. As technology progresses and the community evolves, the Gateway API provides a powerful and flexible framework, making the transition from traditional Ingress to more modern solutions simpler and more effective.\n\n## References\n\n- [Migrating from Ingress - gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io](https:\/\/gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io\/guides\/migrating-from-ingress\/)\n- [Extending Gateway API support in Istio - istio.io](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2022\/gateway-api-beta\/)\n\n---\n\n*This blog was initially published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/kubernetes-ingress-to-gateway-api-migration\/).*', '\/en\/blog\/gateway-api-istio-ingress-evolution\/')">

              <a href="#" onclick="exportToMarkdown('Deep Dive into Istio 1.22: New Features and Practical Application Advice', 'Explore the new features and practical advice of Istio 1.22, including the delta xDS, path template support, and API upgrades, to optimize service mesh management.', '\nThe recent [release of Istio 1.22](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/news\/releases\/1.22.x\/announcing-1.22\/) includes a plethora of significant updates. This article shares the new features and application recommendations brought by this release.\n\n## Ambient Mode Enters Beta Phase\n\nAlthough Ambient mode has now entered the Beta phase, this does not mean we can completely do away with Sidecars. While the Istio official claims that Ambient mode simplifies operations and significantly reduces memory and CPU usage, it still has limitations and potential complexity issues. For example, while Sidecars are eliminated, the introduction of new ztunnel and waypoint components may pose new challenges. For more detailed information about Ambient mode entering Beta, refer to the [Istio official blog](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2024\/ambient-reaches-beta\/).\n\n**Challenges Introduced by Ambient Mode**\n\n- Management of L7 traffic in Ambient mode is not yet mature\n- mTLS is forced to be enabled at the namespace level, meaning you cannot disable mTLS in Ambient mode\n- Zero-downtime upgrades in Ambient mode have not been resolved\n- Lack of best practices for coexistence and migration from Sidecar mode\n\nFor a comparison of Sidecar mode and Ambient mode, see [Analysis of Limitations in Istio Ambient Mode](\/blog\/istio-ambient-mode-limitations\/).\n\n{{\u003c callout note \u0022Recommendation\u0022\u003e}}\nIf you are just starting with Istio, especially if you only need to automatically enable mTLS for services, you can consider using Ambient mode at this stage. However, for L7 functionalities, it is recommended to wait until Ambient mode is fully mature before considering it for production use.\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\n## Istio API Upgrades\n\nIn the Istio 1.22 release, key APIs related to traffic management, security, and telemetry have officially been upgraded to the \u0060v1\u0060 version. You only need to change the API version of your existing configuration to \u0060v1\u0060, with no other changes needed. These APIs are already mature, and you can safely use the \u0060v1\u0060 version. For environments requiring high stability, Istio has added [validating admission policies](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/reference\/access-authn-authz\/validating-admission-policy\/) to ensure that only \u0060v1\u0060 APIs and fields can be used in the Istio API.\n\nFor example, the following AuthorizationPolicy example.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml {linenos=table,hl_lines=1}\napiVersion: security.istio.io\/v1beta1\nkind: AuthorizationPolicy\nmetadata:\n  name: finance-to-supply-chain\n  namespace: finance\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: finance-app\n  action: ALLOW\n  rules:\n  - from:\n    - source:\n        namespaces: [\u0022finance\u0022]\n    to:\n    - operation:\n        methods: [\u0022GET\u0022, \u0022POST\u0022]\n        paths: [\u0022\/api\/supply1\u0022, \u0022\/api\/supply2\u0022]\n    when:\n    - key: request.headers[:authority]\n      values: [\u0022supply-chain-service.supply-chain.svc.cluster.local\u0022]\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nOther extension-type APIs such as \u0060EnvoyFilter\u0060, \u0060WasmPlugin\u0060, \u0060ProxyConfig\u0060 are still in alpha or beta stages. For more information on API upgrades, please refer to the [v1 API blog](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2024\/v1-apis\/).\n\n{{\u003c callout note \u0022Recommendation\u0022\u003e}}\nFor commonly used functionalities, you can confidently use the \u0060v1\u0060 API. For extension-type APIs that are not yet stable, enabling validating admission policies is recommended to ensure system stability.\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\n## Gateway API Upgrade\n\n[Gateway API](\/blog\/why-gateway-api-is-the-future-of-ingress-and-mesh\/) has been updated to version 1.1.0 and is now widely available. This update extends Istio\u0027s traffic management capabilities, but it is important to be cautious of compatibility issues between Istio\u0027s native APIs and the Gateway API when migrating to the new API to avoid relying on features that are not fully mature yet. For more details, check out the [Gateway API v1.1 blog](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2024\/gateway-mesh-ga\/).\n\n{{\u003c callout note \u0022Recommendation\u0022\u003e}}\nFor existing deployments that are already stable using Istio API, continue using them, especially in scenarios requiring advanced features. For new deployments, consider using the stable version of the Gateway API to take advantage of its modern traffic management capabilities. Due to existing compatibility issues, do not rashly migrate to the Gateway API, as it may not be worth the risk.\n{{\u003c\/ callout\u003e}}\n\n## Delta xDS Enabled by Default\n\nIstio 1.22 version now has delta xDS enabled by default, which is a mechanism to optimize configuration distribution. Compared to the traditional State of the World (SotW) mode, delta xDS only sends changed configurations to the Envoy proxies, thereby significantly reducing the amount of data transmitted over the network and the resource consumption of the control plane. This change is particularly suitable for large-scale deployment environments with frequent configuration updates, improving the efficiency and performance of configuration updates. Additionally, delta xDS also helps manage configuration updates more efficiently in complex network environments or dynamically changing configurations.\n\n{{\u003c callout note \u0022Recommendation\u0022\u003e}}\nThe delta xDS has been developed several versions ago but was not enabled by default. Now that this feature is stable, you can use it with confidence.\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\nFor more on xDS, refer to the [Introduction to Envoy xDS and Configuration Distribution Process in Istio](\/blog\/istio-delta-xds-for-envoy\/).\n\n### Path Template Support with Wildcards for AuthorizationPolicy\n\nIn Istio 1.22, \u0060AuthorizationPolicy\u0060 has added support for [path templates](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/reference\/config\/security\/authorization-policy\/#Operation), greatly enhancing the flexibility and precision of path matching. Prior to this, \u0060AuthorizationPolicy\u0060 did not support wildcards in path configurations. This feature allows for defining paths in HTTP requests using URI templates based on Envoy, including simple wildcards (\u0060*\u0060 and \u0060**\u0060) or named variables, enabling precise matching of single or multiple path components. For example, the path template \u0060\/foo\/{*}\u0060 can match \u0060\/foo\/bar\u0060 but not \u0060\/foo\/bar\/baz\u0060, while \u0060\/foo\/{**}\/\u0060 can match any path starting with \u0060\/foo\/\u0060. This flexible path template design is particularly suitable for dynamic and complex routing rules, further strengthening Istio\u0027s security policy toolbox.\n\nThe diagram below illustrates the wildcard rules for path matching in AuthorizationPolicy.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060mermaid \u0022AuthorizationPolicy Path Matching Wildcard Rules\u0022\ngraph LR\n    A[AuthorizationPolicy Path Matching] --\u003e B(Define Path Templates)\n    B --\u003e C{Path Template Operators}\n    C --\u003e D[\u0022* (Match single segment)\u0022]\n    C --\u003e E[\u0022** (Match multiple segments)\u0022]\n    C --\u003e F[\u0022{name} (Named variable matching one segment)\u0022]\n    C --\u003e G[\u0022{name=**} (Named variable matching multiple segments)\u0022]\n\n    D --\u003e H[\u0022\/foo\/{*} matches \/foo\/bar\u0022]\n    E --\u003e I[\u0022\/foo\/{**}\/ matches \/foo\/bar\/, \/foo\/bar\/baz.txt\u0022]\n    F --\u003e J[\u0022\/videos\/{file} matches \/videos\/1080p5000_00001.m4s\u0022]\n    G --\u003e K[\u0022\/**.mpd matches \/content\/123\/india\/dash\/55\/manifest.mpd\u0022]\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n![AuthorizationPolicy Path Matching Wildcard Rules](dfe9a5d5e2bc91e91e7e24017f56a3db.svg)\n\nFor more on the specific applications and rules of path templates, you can refer to [Envoy\u0027s official documentation](https:\/\/www.envoyproxy.io\/docs\/envoy\/latest\/api-v3\/extensions\/path\/match\/uri_template\/v3\/uri_template_match.proto).\n\n{{\u003c callout note \u0022Tip\u0022\u003e}}\n\u0060AuthorizationPolicy\u0060 finally supports templates in path matching, so you no longer need to manually add paths one by one in your configurations.\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Istio 1.22 release introduces several important updates and improvements. Although some features are widely publicized, they require detailed assessment and appropriate testing in practical use. Hopefully, this blog post helps you understand and apply these new features more deeply to achieve the best results in practice.\n\n## References\n\n- [Gateway API v1.1: Service mesh, GRPCRoute, and a whole lot more - kubernetes.io](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/blog\/2024\/05\/09\/gateway-api-v1-1\/)\n\n---\n\nThis blog was initially published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/istio-service-mesh-new-features-v1_22\/).', '\/en\/blog\/what-is-new-in-istio-1-22\/')">

According to [Tetrate\u0027s discussion](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/do-i-need-a-gateway-or-a-service-mesh\/), the choice depends on the type of network traffic: north-south or east-west. For services primarily handling external requests, Envoy Gateway is the ideal choice. It not only efficiently manages traffic but also seamlessly integrates as you transition to a microservices architecture.\n\nThis article explores the advantages of deploying Envoy Gateway on Kubernetes, its relationship with other service mesh components, and why it\u0027s the ideal choice for exposing services to the public internet.\n\n## Overview of Envoy Gateway and its Role in Service Mesh\n\nEnvoy Gateway is a Kubernetes-native API gateway built around Envoy Proxy. It aims to lower the barrier for users adopting Envoy as an API gateway and lays the foundation for vendors to build value-added products like [Tetrate Enterprise Gateway for Envoy](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/tetrate-enterprise-gateway-for-envoy\/).\n\nEnvoy Gateway is not only an ideal choice for managing north-south traffic but also serves as a crucial component for connecting and securing services within the service mesh. It enhances communication efficiency and security among microservices by providing features such as secure data transmission, traffic routing, load balancing, and fault recovery. Leveraging its built-in Envoy Proxy technology, Envoy Gateway can handle a large number of concurrent connections and complex traffic management policies while maintaining low latency and high throughput.\n\nFurthermore, the tight integration of Envoy Gateway with the Kubernetes Gateway API allows for declarative configuration and management, significantly simplifying the deployment and update processes of gateways within the service mesh. This integration not only improves operational efficiency but also enables Envoy Gateway to seamlessly collaborate with solutions like Istio without adding extra complexity.\n\nThe figure below illustrates the relationship between Envoy Gateway and the service mesh.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060mermaid\ngraph TB\n    subgraph Kubernetes[\u0022Kubernetes Cluster\u0022]\n        eg[\u0022Envoy Gateway\u0022]\n        svcs[\u0022Services\u0022]\n        pods[\u0022Pods\u0022]\n        gwapi[\u0022Kubernetes Gateway API\u0022]\n        eg -- \u0022Manages North-South Traffic\u0022 --\u003e svcs\n        eg -- \u0022Configured by\u0022 --\u003e gwapi\n        gwapi -. \u0022Defines routing specs\u0022 .-\u003e svcs\n    end\n\n    subgraph SM[\u0022Service Mesh\u0022]\n        smc[\u0022Service Mesh Control Plane (e.g., Istio, Linkerd)\u0022]\n        smp[\u0022Service Mesh Data Plane (Envoy Sidecars)\u0022]\n        smc -- \u0022Configures\u0022 --\u003e smp\n        smp -- \u0022Handles East-West Traffic\u0022 --\u003e pods\n    end\n\n    eg -.-\u003e smp\n    svcs -. \u0022Part of\u0022 .-\u003e SM\n    svcs -- \u0022Connects to\u0022 --\u003e pods\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n![Mermaid Diagram](17a407873a0c96afbde9bb6b252814d4.svg)\n\n\n\nIn a Kubernetes cluster, Envoy Gateway is responsible for managing north-south traffic, i.e., traffic entering and leaving the cluster, and is configured through the Kubernetes Gateway API, which defines routing specifications for services. Services within the cluster directly connect to pods. In the service mesh, the control plane (e.g., Istio or Linkerd) configures Envoy sidecars in the data plane, which handles east-west traffic within the cluster. In this system, Envoy Gateway can collaborate with the service mesh, but they independently manage traffic in different directions.\n\nThink of Envoy Gateway as the main entry point to a city (e.g., customs), where all traffic (like various vehicles) must pass through. It acts as a strict gatekeeper, responsible for inspection and guidance, ensuring each packet (like each passenger) is accurately delivered to its destination. In the city of Kubernetes, Envoy Gateway manages all inbound traffic, ensuring data flows securely and efficiently into the city and is accurately delivered to services within the city.\n\nOnce inside the city, the service mesh takes over, acting as a series of transportation networks within the city. Envoy sidecars in the service mesh are like taxis or buses within the city, responsible for transporting packets from the port to their specific destinations within the city. Envoy Gateway ensures smooth entry for external requests, and then the service mesh efficiently handles these requests within the cluster.\n\nThe support for Kubernetes Gateway API by Envoy Gateway can be seen as a significant upgrade to our city\u0027s traffic signal system. It not only provides clearer and more personalized guidance for incoming data flows but also makes the entire city\u0027s traffic operations more intelligent.\n\n## Core Features and Advantages of Envoy Gateway\n\nEnvoy Gateway offers several core features that make it a prominent choice for an API gateway:\n\n- **Simplified Configuration**: Through direct integration with the Kubernetes Gateway API, Envoy Gateway allows developers to use Kubernetes custom resources to declaratively configure routing rules, security policies, and traffic management.\n- **Performance and Scalability**: Built on battle-tested Envoy Proxy, it delivers outstanding performance and scalability, effortlessly handling thousands of services and millions of requests per second.\n- **Security Features**: Built-in support for various security measures such as SSL\/TLS termination, OAuth2, OIDC authentication, and fine-grained access control.\n- **Observability**: Provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities including detailed metrics, logs, and tracing, crucial for diagnosing and understanding traffic behavior.\n\n## Relationship with Gateway API\n\nThe introduction of the Gateway API in Kubernetes provides a powerful new way to integrate and configure ingress gateways, offering higher flexibility and functionality compared to traditional ingress. As discussed in [this blog](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/introducing-the-gateway-api\/), the Gateway API simplifies gateway management, allowing developers to define custom routing rules, TLS termination policies, and traffic policies using Kubernetes-native resources.\n\nThe Kubernetes Gateway API serves as the cornerstone of Envoy Gateway, providing a more expressive, flexible, and role-based approach to configuring gateways and routes within the Kubernetes ecosystem. This API offers custom resource definitions (CRDs) such as GatewayClass, Gateway, HTTPRoute, etc. Envoy Gateway utilizes these resources to create a user-friendly and consistent configuration model that aligns with Kubernetes\u0027 native principles.\n\n{{\u003ccallout note \u0022What is an API Gateway?\u0022\u003e}}\n\nAn API Gateway is a comprehensive management and hosting service for APIs. Serving as an intermediary layer between applications and backend services, it not only handles lifecycle events like creation, maintenance, deployment, running, and retiring but also performs additional critical functions. A robust API Gateway should provide the following features to enhance and extend its basic definition:\n\n1. **Traffic Control**: Ability to manage and control traffic to backend services, including request routing, load balancing, circuit breaking, and rate limiting, ensuring the stability and high availability of backend services.\n2. **Security Assurance**: Authentication, authorization, and encryption capabilities to effectively manage and protect API security. This involves authentication mechanisms, API key management, OAuth, JWT, mTLS, etc., ensuring that only authorized users and services can access the API.\n3. **Monitoring and Analytics**: Real-time monitoring and logging functionalities to track API usage, performance metrics, anomaly detection, and traffic pattern analysis, optimizing API performance and responsiveness.\n4. **Change Management**: Support for managing API changes, including version control and progressive deployment (such as blue-green or canary release), for seamless transition to new versions while minimizing impact on end users.\n5. **Request and Response Transformation**: Allow transformation of incoming and outgoing API calls, such as from REST to GraphQL, or adding, removing, and modifying request and response headers.\n6. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Support**: Manage and control cross-origin requests, allowing frontend applications from different domains to securely call backend APIs.\n7. **Quotas and Billing**: Set quota limits for API usage, while also supporting billing functionalities for commercialized API offerings.\n8. **Developer-Friendly Developer Portal**: Provide a developer-facing portal, enabling third-party developers to easily discover, test, and integrate APIs.\n9. **Protocol Support**: Support for various network protocols, including HTTP\/HTTPS, WebSocket, gRPC, etc., ensuring compatibility with a variety of clients and services.\n10. **Plug-ability and Extensibility**: Allow extension of API Gateway functionality through plugins or middleware, enabling flexible adaptation to various middleware services based on business requirements.\n11. **Service Governance**: Integration with service registration and discovery mechanisms to accommodate the dynamics of services in a microservices architecture.\n\nIn conclusion, the role of an API Gateway extends far beyond simple API lifecycle management. It is a key component in realizing microservices architecture, ensuring service security, improving operational efficiency, and optimizing user experience. Through these extensive functionalities, the API Gateway becomes an indispensable part of modern cloud-native applications.\n\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\n## Overview of Envoy Gateway Architecture\n\nThe architecture of Envoy Gateway is designed to be lightweight and concise. It consists of a control plane that dynamically configures an Envoy proxy running as the data plane. This separation of concerns ensures that the gateway can scale with increasing traffic without affecting the efficiency of the control plane.\n\nThe architecture diagram of Envoy Gateway is shown below.\n\n![Envoy Gateway Architecture Diagram](envoy-gateway-arch.svg)\n\nAt the core of this architecture is the Envoy Gateway, which is an instance of the Envoy proxy responsible for handling all traffic in and out of the Kubernetes cluster. Upon initial startup, Envoy Gateway provides static configuration through configuration files, establishing the basic parameters of its operation.\n\nThe dynamic aspect of Envoy Gateway configuration is handled by providers, which define the interaction between the gateway and Kubernetes or other dynamic configuration input sources. The resource monitor is responsible for monitoring changes to Kubernetes resources, with particular attention to CRUD operations related to custom resource definitions (CRDs).\n\nAs changes occur, resource transformers intervene to translate these external resources into a form understandable by Envoy Gateway. This transformation process is further facilitated by provider-specific infrastructure managers, which are responsible for managing resources related to specific clouds or infrastructure providers, shaping the infrastructure into an intermediate representation crucial for the gateway\u0027s functionality.\n\nThis intermediate representation then transforms into the xDS intermediate representation, serving as the precursor to the final xDS configuration understood and executed by Envoy. The xDS translator plays the role of converting this intermediate representation into specific xDS configurations.\n\nThese configurations are delivered and executed by xDS servers, which act as services diligently managing Envoy instances based on the xDS configurations they receive. As the actual running proxy, Envoy ultimately receives these configurations from xDS servers, interprets them, and implements them to effectively manage traffic requests.\n\nUltimately, all requests are redirected to the final destination of Envoy Gateway routes for traffic, which are the backend services.\n\n## Comparison with Other Gateways\n\nCompared to other popular solutions such as Istio\u0027s Ingress Gateway or NGINX Ingress, Envoy Gateway stands out with its native integration with Kubernetes and its focus on leveraging the full potential of Envoy. The table below compares various open-source API gateways from multiple aspects.\n\n| **API Gateway** | **Supported Authentication \u0026 Authorization Strategies**      | **Supported Service Discovery Components** | **Supported Protocols**          | **Control Plane Configuration Distribution Method** | **Supported Plugin Extension Mechanism** | **Foundation Affiliation** |\n| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| Envoy Gateway   | OAuth2, JWT, mTLS, OIDC                                      | Kubernetes, EDS                            | HTTP, HTTPS, gRPC                | xDS                                                 | Envoy Filter Based                       | CNCF                       |\n| Kuma            | mTLS, JWT                                                    | Kubernetes, Consul                         | HTTP, HTTPS, gRPC, TCP           | REST, gRPC                                          | Lua, Go Based                            | CNCF                       |\n| NGINX Ingress   | RBAC                                                         | Kubernetes                                 | HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP            | Kubernetes CRD                                      | Nginx Module Based                       | N\/A                        |\n| APISIX          | OAuth2, JWT, Key Auth, Basic Auth, mTLS, OIDC, LDAP, OpenID, and others | Kubernetes, DNS, Consul, Nacos, Eureka     | HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP, WebSocket | REST, CLI, Web UI                                   | Lua, Wasm Based                          | Apache Software Foundation |\n| Kong            | OAuth2, JWT, Basic Auth, Key Auth                            | Kubernetes, DNS, Consul                    | HTTP, HTTPS, gRPC, WebSocket     | REST, gRPC, Web UI                                  | Lua Based                                | N\/A                        |\n| Emissary        | Basic Auth                                                   | Kubernetes                                 | HTTP, HTTPS, gRPC                | Kubernetes CRD                                      | Lua, Go Based                            | CNCF                       |\n\n## Quick Start with Envoy Gateway\n\nTo quickly get started with Envoy Gateway, you can set up a local experimental environment using the following simplified steps. First, start a local Kubernetes cluster:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nminikube start --driver=docker --cpus=2 --memory=2g\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nNext, deploy the Gateway API CRD and Envoy Gateway itself:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nhelm install eg oci:\/\/docker.io\/envoyproxy\/gateway-helm --version v1.0.1 -n envoy-gateway-system --create-namespace\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThen, install the gateway configuration and deploy a sample application:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl apply -f https:\/\/github.com\/envoyproxy\/gateway\/releases\/download\/v1.0.1\/quickstart.yaml -n default\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nTo expose the LoadBalancer service, here we use port forwarding as an example. You can also choose to use \u0060minikube tunnel\u0060 or install [MetalLB](https:\/\/metallb.universe.tf\/installation\/) as a load balancer:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nexport ENVOY_SERVICE=$(kubectl get svc -n envoy-gateway-system --selector=gateway.envoyproxy.io\/owning-gateway-namespace=default,gateway.envoyproxy.io\/owning-gateway-name=eg -o jsonpath=\u0027{.items[0].metadata.name}\u0027)\nkubectl -n envoy-gateway-system port-forward service\/${ENVOY_SERVICE} 8888:80 \u0026\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nTest if your Envoy Gateway is working properly with the following command:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\ncurl --verbose --header \u0022Host: www.example.com\u0022 http:\/\/localhost:8888\/get\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nFor more detailed installation and configuration steps, visit the Envoy Gateway website. With these steps, you can quickly start exploring the capabilities of Envoy Gateway.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEnvoy Gateway not only optimizes Layer 7 gateway configuration in the cloud-native era but also provides a smooth transition from edge gateways to service meshes. As the promotion of service meshes faces some challenges, such as the intrusiveness to applications and issues driving by operations teams, edge gateways are more readily accepted by development teams. Envoy Gateway, with its simplified Kubernetes Gateway API, enhances traffic management and observability capabilities. Additionally, the transition from Envoy Gateway to Istio is a confident technical advancement for teams already familiar with Envoy features, supporting seamless switching from the standard Kubernetes Gateway API to Istio Ingress Gateway or continuing to collaborate with Istio as a custom solution. These features make Envoy Gateway a gateway choice worth investing in the cloud-native era.\n\nStay tuned for the subsequent parts of this blog series, where we will delve into configuring and optimizing Envoy Gateway, providing practical guides, and showcasing a wider range of real-world use cases.\n\n---\n\nThis blog was initially published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/envoy-microservices-overview\/).\n', '\/en\/blog\/envoy-gateway-introduction\/')">

This blog will provide an overview of the updates bundled in this release.\n\n## Gateway API: Revolutionizing Service Mesh\n\nOur[ previous blog](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/why-the-gateway-api-is-the-unified-future-of-ingress-for-kubernetes-and-service-mesh\/) highlighted the Gateway API’s potential to harmonize ingress gateways in Kubernetes and service mesh, opening doors to cross-namespace traffic support. With Istio’s official endorsement, the Gateway API takes center stage. While traditionally applied to north-south traffic (the ingress and egress of the mesh), it now extends its prowess to the realm of east-west traffic, the lifeblood within the mesh.\n\nIn Kubernetes, services wear multiple hats, handling tasks from service discovery and DNS to workload selection, routing and load balancing. Yet, control over these functions has been limited, with workload selection being the notable exception. The Gateway API changes the game, putting you in command of service routing. This introduces some overlap with Istio’s VirtualService, as both wield influence over traffic routing. Here’s a glimpse into three scenarios:\n\n1. **Internal Kubernetes Requests:** Without Istio, all internal traffic in Kubernetes takes the service route.\n2. **North-South Traffic:** By applying the Gateway API to the Ingress gateway, incoming traffic to Kubernetes follows xRoute (currently supporting HTTPRoute, TCPRoute and gRPCRoute) to services.\n3. **East-West Traffic:** Inside Istio, as traffic enters the data plane, xRoute of the Gateway API takes charge. It guides the traffic to either the original or a new destination service.\n\n![Figure 1: Traffic routing.](gateway-api-request.svg)\n\nThis dynamic fusion of the Gateway API with Istio not only refines service networking but also solidifies Istio’s significance in the Kubernetes ecosystem.\n\n## Gateway API for Service Mesh: A Deeper Dive\n\nAt its current experimental stage (as of v0.8.0), the Gateway API for Service Mesh introduces a fresh approach to configuring service mesh support in Kubernetes. It directly links individual route resources (such as HTTPRoute) with Service resources, streamlining the configuration process.\n\nHere are some key takeaways:\n\n**Experimental Stage:** As of version v0.8.0, the Gateway API for Service Mesh is still experimental. It’s advised not to use it in production environments.\n\n**Service and Route Association:** Unlike using Gateway and GatewayClass resources, individual route resources are linked directly with Service resources when configuring a service mesh.\n\n**Frontend and Backend Aspects of Service:** The Service’s frontend encompasses its name and cluster IP, while the backend consists of its collection of endpoint IPs. This distinction facilitates routing within a mesh without introducing redundant resources.\n\n**Route Attachment to Service:** Routes are attached to a Service to apply configuration to any traffic directed to that Service. The traffic follows the mesh’s default behavior if no Routes are attached.\n\n**Namespace Relationships**:\n\n- *Same Namespace:* A Route in the same Namespace as its Service, known as a producer route, is typically created by the workload creator to define acceptable usage. It affects all requests from any client of the workload across any Namespace.\n- *Different Namespaces:* A Route in a different Namespace than its Service, termed a consumer route, refines how a consumer of a given workload makes requests. This Route only influences requests from workloads in the same Namespace as the Route.\n\n![Figure 2: Producer Route and Consumer Route.](gateway-api-reference.svg)\n\n**Combining Routes:** Multiple Routes for the same Service in a single Namespace, whether producer or consumer routes, will be merged according to the Gateway API Route merging rules. This means defining distinct consumer routes for multiple consumers in the same Namespace is impossible.\n\n**Request Flow**:\n\n- A client workload initiates a request for a specific Service in a Namespace.\n- The mesh data plane intercepts the request and identifies the target Service.\n- Based on associated Routes, the request is allowed, rejected, or forwarded to the appropriate workload based on matching rules.\n\nBear in mind that, in the experimental stage, the Gateway API for Service Mesh may undergo further changes and is not recommended for production use.\n\nBut wait, there’s more! Our journey doesn’t end here – the support for ingress traffic using the API is rapidly heading toward General Availability, promising even more dynamic developments!\n\nLet’s delve further into additional enhancements in this release.\n\n## Ambient Mesh Enhancements\n\nThe Istio team has been tirelessly refining the ambient mesh, an innovative deployment model that offers an alternative to the traditional sidecar approach. If you haven’t explored ambient yet, now’s the perfect time to dive into the[ introduction blog post](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2022\/introducing-ambient-mesh\/).\n\nWith this update, we’ve amplified support for \u0060ServiceEntry\u0060, \u0060WorkloadEntry\u0060, \u0060PeerAuthentication\u0060 and DNS proxying. Alongside, bug fixes and reliability enhancements ensure a seamless experience.\n\nRemember, the ambient mesh is in its alpha phase for this release. The Istio community eagerly awaits your feedback to propel it toward Beta.\n\n## Simplified Virtual Machine and Multicluster Experiences\n\nSimplicity is key, especially when working with Virtual Machines and Multicluster setups. In this release, we’ve made the address field optional in the \u0060WorkloadEntry\u0060 resources. This seemingly small adjustment promises to streamline your workflow significantly.\n\n## Elevated Security Configurations\n\nYou can now configure \u0060OPTIONAL_MUTUAL\u0060 for your Istio ingress gateway’s TLS settings, providing the flexibility of optional client certificate validation. Additionally, you can fine-tune your preferred cipher suites used for non-Istio mTLS traffic via \u0060MeshConfig\u0060.\n\nWith these updates, Istio 1.19 empowers you with greater control, flexibility and security in managing your service mesh.\n\nFeel free to explore these enhancements and share your experiences with the Istio community. For more details, refer to the[ official release notes](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/news\/releases\/1.19.x\/announcing-1.19\/).\n\nHappy meshing!\n\n---\n\nThis blog was initially published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/whats-new-in-istio-1-19-gateway-api-and-beyond\/).\n', '\/en\/blog\/istio-119-release\/')">

              <a href="#" onclick="exportToMarkdown('Why the Gateway API Is the Unified Future of Ingress for Kubernetes and Service Mesh', 'This article introduces the ingress gateway and Gateway API in Kubernetes, the new trend of them with service mesh.', '\nIn this blog, you will learn about the Kubernetes Ingress Gateway, the Gateway API, and the emerging Gateway API trend, which enables the convergence of Kubernetes and service mesh.\n\n## Takeaways\n\n- Ingress, the original gateway for Kubernetes, has a resource model that is too simple to fit into today’s programmable networks.\n- The [Gateway API](https:\/\/gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io\/), the latest addition to the Kubernetes portal gateway, separates concerns through role delineation and provides cross-namespace support to make it more adaptable to multi-cloud environments. Most API gateways already support it.\n- The Gateway API provides a new reference model for the convergence of ingress gateways (north-south) and service mesh (east-west, cross-cluster routing), where there is a partial functional overlap.\n\n## History of the Kubernetes ingress gateway\n\nWhen Kubernetes was launched in June 2014, only NodePort and LoadBalancer-type Service objects were available to expose services within the cluster to the outside world. Later, [Ingress ](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/concepts\/services-networking\/ingress\/)was introduced to offer more control over incoming traffic.. To preserve its portability and lightweight design, the Ingress API matured more slowly than other Kubernetes APIs; it was not upgraded to GA until Kubernetes 1.19.\n\nIngress’ primary objective is to expose HTTP applications using a straightforward declarative syntax. When creating an Ingress or setting a default *IngressClass* in Kubernetes, you can deploy several Ingress Controllers and define the controller the gateway uses via *IngressClass*. Kubernetes currently supports only AWS, GCE, and Nginx Ingress controllers by default; many [third-party ingress controllers](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/concepts\/services-networking\/ingress-controllers\/) are also supported.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the workflow of Kubernetes Ingress.\n\n![Figure 1: Kubernetes ingress workflow](ingress-flow.svg)\n\nThe detailed process is as follows:\n\n- Kubernetes cluster administrators deploy an Ingress Controller in Kubernetes.\n- The Ingress Controller continuously monitors changes to *IngressClass* and Ingress objects in the Kubernetes API Server.\n- Administrators apply *IngressClass* and Ingress to deploy the gateway.\n- Ingress Controller creates the corresponding ingress gateway and configures the routing rules according to the administrator’s configuration.\n- If in the cloud, the client accesses the load balancer for that ingress gateway.\n- The gateway will route the traffic to the corresponding back-end service based on the host and path in the HTTP request.\n\nIstio supports both the Ingress and Gateway APIs. Below is an example configuration using the Istio Ingress Gateway, which will be created later using the Gateway API:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io\/v1\nkind: IngressClass\nmetadata:\n  name: istio\nspec:\n  controller: istio.io\/ingress-controller\n---\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io\/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: ingress\nspec:\n  ingressClassName: istio\n  rules:\n  - host: httpbin.example.com\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: \/\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          service:\n            name: httpbin\n            port: 8000\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nNote: You must specify the *IngressClass* in the *ingressClassName* field in the Ingress spec. Otherwise, the ingress gateway will not be created.\n\n## Limitations of Kubernetes Ingress\n\nAlthough IngressClass decouples the ingress gateway from the back-end implementation, it still has significant limitations.\n\n- Ingress is too simple for most real-world use and it only supports HTTP protocol routing.\n- It only supports host and path matching, and there is no standard configuration for advanced routing features, which can only be achieved through annotation, such as URL redirection using Nginx Ingress Controller, which requires configuration of *nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io\/rewrite-target* annotation, which is no longer adaptable to the needs of a programmable proxy.\n- The situation where services in different namespaces must be bound to the same gateway often arises in practical situations where the ingress gateway cannot be shared across multiple namespaces.\n- No delineation of responsibilities for creating and managing ingress gateways, resulting in developers having to not only configure gateway routes but also create and manage gateways themselves.\n\n## Kubernetes Gateway API\n\nThe Gateway API is a collection of API resources: *GatewayClass*, *Gateway*, *HTTPRoute*, *TCPRoute*, *ReferenceGrant*, etc. The Gateway API exposes a more generic proxy API that can be used for more protocols than HTTP and models more infrastructure components, providing better deployment and management options for cluster operations.\n\nIn addition, the Gateway API achieves configuration decoupling by separating resource objects that people can manage in different roles. The following diagram shows the roles and objects in the Gateway API.\n\n![Figure: Roles and componentes in Kubernetes Gateway API](gateway-api-roles.svg)\n\nThe following is an example of using the Gateway API in Istio.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io\/v1alpha2\nkind: Gateway\nmetadata:\n  name: gateway\n  namespace: istio-ingress\nspec:\n  gatewayClassName: istio\n  listeners:\n  - name: default\n    hostname: \u0022*.example.com\u0022\n    port: 80\n    protocol: HTTP\n    allowedRoutes:\n      namespaces:\n        from: All\n---\napiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io\/v1alpha2\nkind: HTTPRoute\nmetadata:\n  name: http\n  namespace: default\nspec:\n  parentRefs:\n  - name: gateway\n    namespace: istio-ingress\n  hostnames: [\u0022httpbin.example.com\u0022]\n  rules:\n  - matches:\n    - path:\n        type: PathPrefix\n        value: \/\n    backendRefs:\n    - name: httpbin\n      port: 8000\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nSimilar to Ingress, Gateway uses *gatewayClassName* to declare the controller it uses, which needs to be created by the platform administrator and allows client requests for the **.example.com* domain. Application developers can create routing rules in the namespace where their service resides, in this case, default, and bind to the Gateway via parentRefs, but only if the Gateway explicitly allows them to do so (via the rules set in the *allowRoutes* field).\n\nWhen you apply the above configuration, Istio will automatically create a load-balancing gateway for you. The following diagram shows the workflow of the Gateway API.\n\n![Figure 3: Gateway API workflow](gateway-api-flow.svg)\n\nThe detailed process is as follows:\n\n- The infrastructure provider provides *GatewayClass* and Gateway Controller.\n- Platform operator deploy Gateway (multiple deployments possible, or using different *GatewayClasses*).\n- Gateway Controller continuously monitors changes to the *GatewayClass* and *Gateway* objects in the Kubernetes API Server.\n- Gateway controller will create the corresponding gateway based on cluster operations and maintenance configuration.\n- Application developers apply *xRoutes* and bind them to the service.\n- If in the cloud, the client accesses the load balancer for that ingress gateway.\n- The gateway will route to the corresponding back-end service based on the matching criteria in the traffic request.\n\nFrom the above steps, we can see that the Gateway API has a clear division of roles compared to Ingress and that routing rules can be decoupled from the gateway configuration, significantly increasing management flexibility.\n\nThe following diagram shows the route flow after it is accessed at the gateway and processed.\n\n![Figure 4: Gateway API route flow](traffic-flow.svg)\n\nFrom this figure, we can see that the route is bound to the gateway. The route is generally deployed in the same namespace as its backend services. Suppose the route is in a different namespace, and you need to explicitly give the route cross-namespace reference rights in \u0060ReferenceGrant\u0060, for example. In that case, the following HTTPRoute foo in the foo namespace can refer to the bar namespace bar service in the bar namespace.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\nkind: HTTPRoute\nmetadata:\n  name: foo\n  namespace: foo\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - matches:\n    - path: \/bar\n    forwardTo:\n      backend:\n      - name: bar\n        namespace: bar\n---\nkind: ReferenceGrant\nmetadata:\n  name: bar\n  namespace: bar\nspec:\n  from:\n  - group: networking.gateway.k8s.io\n    kind: HTTPRoute\n    namespace: foo\n  to:\n  - group: \u0022\u0022\n    kind: Service\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nCurrently, the Gateway API only supports HTTPRoute, and the TCPRoute, UDPRoute, TLSRoute and GRCPRoute are still in the experimental stage. The Gateway API is already supported by a large number of gateway and service mesh projects, and please [check the support status in the official Gateway documentation.](https:\/\/gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io\/implementations\/)\n\n## Ingress Gateway and Service Mesh\n\nThe service mesh focuses on east-west traffic, i.e., traffic within a Kubernetes cluster, but most service meshes, including Istio, also provide ingress gateway functionality. But, since Istio’s ingress functionality and API are more advanced than we need for this example, we’ll use [Service Mesh Interface (SMI)](https:\/\/smi-spec.io\/) to illustrate the relationship between the ingress gateway and the service mesh.\n\nSMI is a CNCF incubation project, open-sourced in 2019, that defines a common standard for vendor-independent service mesh running in Kubernetes.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the overlap between the Gateway API and the SMI.\n\n![Figure 5: Gateway API vs SMI](gateway-smi-overlay.svg)\n\nFrom the diagram, we can see a clear overlap between the Gateway API and SMI in the traffic specification section. These overlaps result in the same functionality that needs to be implemented repeatedly in both the Gateway API and the service mesh.\n\n## Traffic Management in the Istio Service Mesh\n\nOf course, not all service meshes are fully SMI-compliant. Istio, the most popular service mesh implementation, provides rich traffic management features but does not have a separate policy API for these features, instead coupling them in *VirtualService* and *DestinationRule*, as shown below.\n\n### VirtualService\n\n- Routing: canary release, matching routes based on HTTP header, URI, etc.\n- Error injection: HTTP error code injection, HTTP delay injection.\n- Traffic splitting: percentage-based traffic splitting.\n- Traffic mirroring: mirroring a certain percentage of traffic to other clusters.\n- Timeout: set the timeout period, after which the request will fail.\n- Retry: set the retry policy, such as trigger conditions, number of retries, interval time, etc.\n\n### DestinationRule\n\nLoad balancing: setting up load balancing policies, such as simple load balancing, locality-aware load balancing, and area-weighted load balancing.\nCircuit Breaking: Outlier detection and connection pool settings to remove anomalous nodes from the load balancing pool.\n\n*VirtualService* mainly handles routing-related functions, while *DestinationRule* is responsible for adding and ejecting nodes from the cluster and load balancing.\n\nGateway API Converging the Ingress Gateway from Kubernetes and Service Mesh\n\nAs mentioned above, there is a partial functional intersection between the Gateway API and the service mesh. To reduce duplication of development and enable the modeling of common concerns between the Gateway API and the service mesh, the Gateway API Working Group has proposed the [Gateway API Mesh Management and Administration](https:\/\/gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io\/contributing\/gamma\/) (GAMMA) initiative.\n\nUnder this initiative, advanced traffic management features that vary in detail across gateway implementations, such as timeouts, retries, health checks, etc., will all be implemented by individual providers through [policy attachment](https:\/\/gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io\/references\/policy-attachment\/). You can specify the resource object to which the policy attachment is attached via the *targetRef* field, as shown below.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: networking.acme.io\/v1alpha1\nkind: RetryPolicy\nmetadata:\n  name: foo\nspec:\n  override:\n    maxRetries: 10\n  default:\n    maxRetries: 5\n  targetRef:\n    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io\/v1alpha2\n    kind: HTTPRoute\n    name: foo\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nIn this example, the retry policy is attached to a resource named *foo* and *HTTPRoute*. Policy attachments are connected to different resource objects with varying priorities for effectiveness. For instance, GatewayClass is a cluster-level resource and will take precedence if the policy attachment is overlaid on it.\n\nYou can assign override and default values to additional policies whose priority in the ingress and the different resources in the mesh hierarchy are shown in the figure below.\n\n![Figure 6: Kubernetes Ingress and Mesh with Overrides and Default Priorities](policy-attachment-priority.svg)\n\nCurrently, the Gateway API is being explored to handle mesh traffic, and several [design options](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1T_DtMQoq2tccLAtJTpo3c0ohjm25vRS35MsestSL9QU\/edit#heading=h.6ks49gf06yii) have been proposed.\n\n## Envoy Gateway\n\nThe first open-source version of Envoy Gateway, [v0.2, was released](https:\/\/blog.envoyproxy.io\/introducing-envoy-gateway-ad385cc59532) in October 2022. It was created based on the Envoy proxy’s compliance with the Gateway API, of which [Tetrate ](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/)is a core sponsor. Its expressive, scalable, role-oriented API design through ingress and L4\/L7 traffic routing makes it the foundation for vendors to build value-added API gateway products.\n\nLong before Envoy Gateway was released, Envoy was massively adopted as one of the most popular cloud-native proxies, with several Gateway software builds based on Envoy, and the Istio service mesh used it as the default sidecar proxy and configured these distributed proxies via the xDS protocol. Envoy Gateway also uses xDS to configure the Envoy fleet. The following diagram illustrates the architecture of Envoy Gateway.\n\n![Figure: Envoy Gateway architecture](envoy-gateway-arch.svg)\n\nThe infrastructure provider will provide you with GatewayGlass. You can create an Envoy Gateway by creating a Gateway declaration. Your routing and policy attachments in the Gateway will be sent to the Envoy fleet via the xDS protocol.\n\nFor further information about Envoy Gateway, please read\n\n- [Hands on with the New Kubernetes Gateway API, Using Envoy Gateway 0.2](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/hands-on-with-the-gateway-api-using-envoy-gateway-0-2\/)\n- [Gateway to the Future: the New Kubernetes Gateway API and Envoy Gateway 0.2](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/gateway-to-the-future-the-new-gateway-api-and-envoy-gateway-0-2\/)\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Gateway API, as the next-generation Kubernetes Ingress API, provides a better degree of API specification for Kubernetes gateway providers as opposed to the Ingress API before, enriching the functionality of the ingress gateway while ensuring its portability and facilitating the management of gateways by different stakeholders through the separation of concerns. Finally, the GAMMA initiative is promoting the integration of the Ingress Gateway with the Gateway API for service mesh, and policy attachments may further extend the functionality of the Gateway API to east-west gateways.\n\n---\n\n*This blog was originally published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/why-the-gateway-api-is-the-unified-future-of-ingress-for-kubernetes-and-service-mesh\/).*\n', '\/en\/blog\/why-gateway-api-is-the-future-of-ingress-and-mesh\/')">
