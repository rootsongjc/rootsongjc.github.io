              <a href="#" onclick="exportToMarkdown('Implementing GitOps and Canary Deployment with Argo Project and Istio', 'This article discusses how to use Deployment, ArgoCD, and Istio to implement GitOps and canary deployment. ', '\nThe development of cloud-native applications has led to a shift in development to the left and a higher frequency of application iteration, which has given rise to the need for GitOps. This article will introduce how to use the Argo project, including ArgoCD and Argo Rollouts, to achieve GitOps and canary deployment with Istio. There is also a demonstration in the article that shows how to achieve GitOps based on the Istio environment provided by Tetrate Service Express (also applicable to Tetrate Service Bridge).\n\nThe deployment architecture diagram of the demo in this article is shown in Figure 1. If you are already familiar with the deployment strategies and Argo projects introduced in this article, you can skip directly to the demo section.\n\n![Figure 1: Architecture diagram of using Istio and Argo projects in TSE\/TSB to achieve GitOps and canary release](f1.svg)\n\n## Deployment strategy\n\nFirst of all, I want to briefly introduce the two deployment strategies supported by Argo Rollouts, which can achieve zero-downtime deployment.\n\nThe steps of blue-green deployment and canary deployment are shown in Figure 2.\n\n![Figure 2: Steps of blue-green deployment and canary deployment](f2.svg)\n\n- Blue-green deployment is a strategy that deploys the new version of the application in a separate environment in parallel without affecting the current production environment. In blue-green deployment, the current production environment is called the \u0022blue environment,\u0022 and the environment where the new version of the application is deployed is called the \u0022green environment.\u0022 Once the green environment is considered stable and has passed the test, the traffic will gradually switch from the blue environment to the green environment, allowing users to gradually access the new version. If problems occur during the switching process, it can be quickly rolled back to the blue environment to minimize the impact on users. The advantage of blue-green deployment is that it can provide high availability and zero-downtime deployment.\n- Canary deployment is a strategy for gradually introducing new versions or features into the production environment. In canary deployment, the new version or feature is first deployed to a small number of users in the production environment, called \u0022canary users.\u0022 By monitoring the feedback and performance indicators of canary users, the development team can evaluate the stability and reliability of the new version or feature. If there are no problems, more users can be gradually included in the canary deployment until all users use the new version. If a problem is found, it can be quickly rolled back or fixed to avoid negative effects on the entire user group. The advantage of canary deployment is that it can quickly identify problems and make adjustments in a small impact area.\n\nThe main difference between blue-green deployment and canary deployment is the deployment method and the scale of the changes. Blue-green deployment deploys the entire application in a new environment and then switches, which is suitable for large-scale changes, such as major upgrades of the entire application. Canary deployment gradually introduces new versions or features, which is suitable for small-scale changes, such as adding or modifying a single feature.\n\nIn terms of application scenarios, blue-green deployment is suitable for systems with higher requirements for high availability and zero-downtime deployment. When deploying large-scale changes, blue-green deployment can ensure stability and reliability and can quickly roll back to cope with unexpected situations. Canary deployment is suitable for systems that need to quickly verify new features or versions. By gradually introducing changes, problems can be discovered early and adjustments can be made to minimize the impact on users.\n\n## Release strategy of Kubernetes Deployment\n\nIn Kubernetes, the Deployment resource object is one of the main tools for managing the deployment and updating of applications. Deployment provides a declarative way to define the expected state of an application and implements the release strategy through the controller\u0027s functionality. The architecture of Deployment is shown in Figure 3, where the colored squares represent pods of different versions.\n\n![Figure 3: Architecture diagram of Kubernetes Deployment](f3.svg)\n\nThe release strategy can be configured in the spec field of Deployment. Here are some common release policy options:\n\n1. **Management of ReplicaSet**: Deployment uses ReplicaSet to create and manage replicas of an application. The desired number of replicas can be specified by setting the \u0060spec.replicas\u0060 field. During the release process, the Kubernetes controller ensures that the number of replicas of the new version\u0027s ReplicaSet gradually increases when created, and the number of replicas of the old version\u0027s ReplicaSet gradually decreases when deleted to achieve a smooth switch.\n2. **Rolling update policy**: Deployment supports multiple rolling update policies, which can be selected by setting the \u0060spec.strategy.type\u0060 field. Common policies include:\n    - **RollingUpdate**: The default policy updates replicas gradually at a certain time interval. The number of replicas that are not available at the same time and the number of additional available replicas can be controlled by setting the \u0060spec.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable\u0060 and \u0060spec.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxSurge\u0060 fields.\n    - **Recreate**: This policy first deletes all replicas of the old version during the update process and then creates replicas of the new version. This policy will cause the application to be temporarily unavailable during the update.\n3. **Version control**: Deployment sets labels for each version\u0027s ReplicaSet through the \u0060spec.template.metadata.labels\u0060 field so that the controller can track and manage them accurately. This way, multiple versions of ReplicaSet can coexist, and the number of replicas of each version can be accurately controlled.\n\nBy using these configuration options, Deployment can achieve different release strategies. Updating the spec field of the Deployment object can trigger the release of a new version. The Kubernetes controller will automatically handle the creation, update, and deletion of replicas according to the specified policy to achieve smooth application updates and deployment strategies.\n\n## Implementing GitOps with ArgoCD\n\nYou can use Deployment to manually manage release strategies, but to achieve automation, we also need to use GitOps tools such as ArgoCD.\n\nArgoCD is a GitOps-based continuous delivery tool used to automate and manage the deployment of Kubernetes applications. It provides some key help to improve the efficiency and reliability of application deployment.\n\nHere are some of the help ArgoCD provides for Kubernetes application deployment:\n\n1. **Declarative configuration**: ArgoCD uses a declarative way to define the expected state of an application and stores the application configuration in a Git repository. By versioning and continuous integration\/continuous delivery (CI\/CD) processes, it is easy to track and manage application configuration changes.\n2. **Continuous deployment**: ArgoCD can monitor configuration changes in the Git repository and automatically deploy the application to the Kubernetes environment. It provides customizable synchronization policies that can automatically trigger application deployment and updates, achieving continuous deployment.\n3. **State comparison and automatic repair**: ArgoCD periodically checks the current state of the application and compares it with the expected state. If inconsistencies are found, it will automatically try to repair and restore the application to the desired state to ensure consistency between the expected and actual states.\n4. **Multi-environment management**: ArgoCD supports managing multiple Kubernetes environments, such as development, testing, and production environments. It is easy to deploy and synchronize application configurations between different environments, ensuring consistency and controllability.\n\nCompared to Deployment resource objects, ArgoCD provides more advanced features and workflows that complement the capabilities of native Kubernetes resource objects:\n\n**GitOps-based configuration management**: ArgoCD stores application configuration in a Git repository, enabling GitOps-based configuration management. This approach ensures that configuration changes are traceable, auditable, and can be integrated with existing CI\/CD pipelines.\n\n**Automated deployment and continuous delivery**: ArgoCD can automatically detect configuration changes in the Git repository and deploy applications to Kubernetes environments, enabling automated deployment and continuous delivery.\n\n**State management and automatic recovery**: ArgoCD continuously monitors the state of applications and compares it to the expected state. If inconsistencies are detected, it automatically recovers and ensures that the application state remains consistent with the expected state.\n\n## Using Istio to achieve fine-grained traffic routing\n\nAlthough ArgoCD can implement GitOps, it essentially operates on Kubernetes Deployment and controls traffic routing through replica numbers. To achieve fine-grained traffic routing, services meshes like Istio are used.\n\nIstio achieves finer-grained traffic routing and application release through the following methods:\n\n**VirtualService**: Istio uses VirtualService to define traffic routing rules. By configuring VirtualService, traffic can be routed and distributed based on request attributes such as request headers, paths, weights, etc., directing requests to different service instances or versions.\n\n**DestinationRule**: Istio\u0027s DestinationRule is used to define service version policies and load balancing settings. By specifying different traffic weights between service instances of different versions, advanced application release policies such as canary release or blue-green deployment can be implemented.\n\n**Traffic control and policies**: Istio provides rich traffic control and policy capabilities such as traffic limiting, fault injection, timeout settings, retry mechanisms, etc. These features help applications achieve higher-level load balancing, fault tolerance, and reliability requirements.\n\nCompared to ArgoCD and Kubernetes Deployment objects, Istio provides the following advantages in application deployment:\n\n**Fine-grained traffic routing control**: Istio provides richer traffic routing capabilities, enabling flexible routing and distribution based on a variety of request attributes, allowing for finer-grained traffic control and management.\n\n**Advanced release policy support**: Istio\u0027s DestinationRule can specify traffic weights between different versions of service instances, supporting advanced application release policies such as canary release and blue-green deployment. This makes version management and release of applications more flexible and controllable.\n\n**Powerful traffic control and policy capabilities**: Istio provides rich traffic control and policy capabilities such as traffic limiting, fault injection, timeout settings, retry mechanisms, etc. These features help applications achieve higher-level load balancing, fault tolerance, and reliability requirements.\n\nCombining Istio with Argo Rollouts can fully leverage the advantages of Istio\u0027s fine-grained traffic routing. Let\u0027s now have a demo together. In our demo, we will use the Kubernetes and Istio environments provided by TSE, implement GitOps using ArgoCD, and implement canary release using Argo Rollouts.\n\n## Demo\n\nThe software versions used in our demo are:\n\n- Kubernetes v1.24.14\n- Istio v1.15.7\n- ArgoCD v2.7.4\n- Argo Rollouts v1.5.1\n- TSE Preview2\n\nWe will use Istio\u0027s VirtualService and DestinationRule to implement traffic grouping routing based on Subset, and use ArgoCD Rollouts for progressive release.\n\n### Deploy ArgoCD and Argo Rollouts\n\nI have created a Kubernetes cluster and added it to TSE in advance, and TSE will automatically install Istio control plane for the cluster. We also need to install ArgoCD and Argo Rollouts:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\n# Install ArgoCD\nkubectl create namespace argocd\nkubectl apply -n argocd -f https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/argoproj\/argo-cd\/stable\/manifests\/install.yaml\n\n# Install ArgoCD CLI on macOS\nbrew install argocd\n\n# Change the service type of argocd-server to LoadBalancer\nkubectl patch svc argocd-server -n argocd -p \u0027{\u0022spec\u0022: {\u0022type\u0022: \u0022LoadBalancer\u0022}}\u0027\n\n# Get the ArgoCD UI address\nARGOCD_ADDR=$(kubectl get svc argocd-server -n argocd -o jsonpath=\u0027{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}\u0027)\n\n# Login using ArgoCD CLI, see https:\/\/argo-cd.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/getting_started\/#4-login-using-the-cli to get password\nargocd login $ARGOCD_ADDR --skip-test-tls --grpc-web --insecure\n\n# Install Argo Rollouts\nkubectl create namespace argo-rollouts\nkubectl apply -n argo-rollouts -f https:\/\/github.com\/argoproj\/argo-rollouts\/releases\/download\/latest\/install.yaml\n\n# Install rollouts plugin on macOS\ncurl -LO https:\/\/github.com\/argoproj\/argo-rollouts\/releases\/download\/v1.5.0\/kubectl-argo-rollouts-darwin-amd64\nchmod \u002bx .\/kubectl-argo-rollouts-darwin-amd64\nsudo mv .\/kubectl-argo-rollouts-darwin-amd64 \/usr\/local\/bin\/kubectl-argo-rollouts\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThis feature is not applicable to TSE Bridge Mode, so we will use TSE Direct Mode to achieve progressive release.\n\n{{\u003ccallout note \u0022💡 What is Bridge Mode and Direct Mode?\u0022\u003e}}\n\n\nDirect Mode and Bridge Mode are two modes in TSE for control plane to issue configuration. They are suitable for flow, security, and gateway group configuration modes. BRIDGED mode is a minimalist mode that allows users to quickly configure the most commonly used features in the service mesh using Tetrate-specific APIs, while DIRECT mode provides greater flexibility for advanced users, allowing them to configure using Istio APIs directly.\n\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\nNext, deploy Rollouts Dashboard:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\ngit clone https:\/\/github.com\/argoproj\/argo-rollouts.git\nkustomize build manifests\/dashboard-install|kubectl apply -n argo-rollouts -f -\nkubectl port-forward svc\/argo-rollouts-dashboard -n argo-rollouts 3100:3100\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nYou can now access the Rollouts Dashboard at [https:\/\/localhost:3100\/rollouts\/](https:\/\/localhost:3100\/rollouts\/).\n\n### Deploy Bookinfo Application\n\nWe have prepared the configuration file for the Bookinfo application (saved in the [tse-gitops-demo](https:\/\/github.com\/tetrateio\/tse-gitops-demo\/) repository), and you can also fork it to your own account and replace it with your own repository. Run the following command to deploy the Bookinfo application:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\nargocd app create bookinfo-app --repo https:\/\/github.com\/tetrateio\/tse-gitops-demo.git --path application --dest-server https:\/\/kubernetes.default.svc --dest-namespace bookinfo --sync-policy automated\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nNote: We set \u0060replicas\u0060 to \u00600\u0060 in the [\u0060reviews\u0060 Deployment](https:\/\/github.com\/tetrateio\/tse-gitops-demo\/blob\/main\/application\/bookinfo.yaml#L151) because we will create Argo Rollouts to manipulate the number of instances of the \u0060reviews\u0060 service. If you set it to a non-zero positive integer here, we will not be able to achieve canary deployment.\n\nNow you can open the ArgoCD UI in your browser, as shown in Figure 4.\n\n![Figure 4: ArgoCD UI](f4.png)\n\nIf you find that the application status is not in sync, you can run the following command or click the SYNC button in the UI.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nargocd app sync bookinfo-app\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## Implementing Fine-grained Traffic Management with Istio\n\nFirst, let\u0027s use Argo CD to create Istio-related resource objects:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nargocd app create bookinfo-tse-conf --repo https:\/\/github.com\/tetrateio\/tse-gitops-demo.git --path argo\/tse --dest-server https:\/\/kubernetes.default.svc --dest-namespace bookinfo --sync-policy automated --self-heal\n\n# Check the creation status\nargocd app get bookinfo-tse-conf\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n### Converting Deployment to Rollout\n\nSuppose we want to release a new version of the \u0060reviews\u0060 service. To achieve zero downtime updates, we will use canary deployment, with the following steps:\n\n1. Reduce the \u0060replicas\u0060 of the \u0060reviews\u0060 Deployment to 0;\n2. Create a Rollout that references the \u0060reviews\u0060 Deployment previously deployed in the Bookinfo application;\n3. Send traffic to the \u0060reviews\u0060 service to achieve automatic canary deployment progress.\n\nYou can view the Rollout and AnalysisTemplate configurations used in this demo on [GitHub](https:\/\/github.com\/tetrateio\/tse-gitops-demo\/tree\/main\/argo\/rollout). Run the following command to deploy \u0060reivews-rollout\u0060:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nargocd app create reviews-rollout --repo https:\/\/github.com\/tetrateio\/tse-gitops-demo.git --path argo\/rollout --dest-server https:\/\/kubernetes.default.svc --dest-namespace bookinfo --sync-policy automated\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nNote: We can use the \u0060argocd\u0060 command to deploy or use \u0060kubectl apply\u0060. It is recommended to use \u0060argocd\u0060 because you can view the deployment status in ArgoCD UI and Argo Rollouts Dashboard at the same time and manage the deployment using the \u0060argocd\u0060 command.\n\nView the status of the \u0060reviews\u0060 rollouts in the [Argo Rollouts Dashboard](https:\/\/localhost:3001\/rollouts\/bookinfo), and use the following command to send traffic to the \u0060reviews\u0060 service for a period of time:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nexport GATEWAY_HOSTNAME=$(kubectl -n bookinfo get service tsb-gateway-bookinfo -o jsonpath=\u0027{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}\u0027)\nwhile 1;do curl -H \u0022Host: bookinfo.tetrate.com\u0022 http:\/\/$GATEWAY_HOSTNAME\/api\/v1\/products\/1\/reviews;sleep 3;done\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nYou will see responses from pods with different rollouts-pod-template-hash labels in the output, which proves that canary deployment is effective. After about 10 minutes, the Argo Rollouts Dashboard you see will be as shown in Figure 5.\n\n![Figure 5: Argo Rollout Dashboard](f5.png)\n\nFrom Figure 5, we can see that canary deployment is progressing smoothly and has reached the third step. This is because the \u0060apdex\u0060 (Application Performance Index) indicator of the \u0060reviews\u0060 service is normal. You can use [Postman to submit GraphQL queries to SkyWalking](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/how-to-use-graphql-to-query-observability-data-from-skywalking-with-postman\/) to verify this, as shown in Figure 6.\n\n![Figure 6: Submitting GraphQL queries to SkyWalking using Postman](f6.png)\n\nThe GraphQL query statement we built is as follows:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060graphql\nquery ReadMetricsValues {\n    readMetricsValues(condition: {\n    name: \u0022service_apdex\u0022, entity: {scope: Service, serviceName: \u0022canary|reviews|bookinfo|cluster-1|-\u0022, normal: true}\n  }, duration: {\n    start: \u00222023-07-13 0812\u0022,\n    end: \u00222023-07-13 0813\u0022,\n    step: MINUTE\n  }) {\n        label\n        values {\n            values {\n                id\n                value\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThis statement queries the \u0060apdex\u0060 indicator of the \u0060canary|reviews|bookinfo|cluster-1|-\u0060 service from UTC \u00602023-07-13 8:12\u0060 to \u00602023 8:13\u0060 for two minutes and obtains the following results:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060json\n{\n    \u0022data\u0022: {\n        \u0022readMetricsValues\u0022: {\n            \u0022label\u0022: null,\n            \u0022values\u0022: {\n                \u0022values\u0022: [\n                    {\n                        \u0022id\u0022: \u0022service_apdex_202307130812_Y2FuYXJ5fHJldmlld3N8Ym9va2luZm98Y2x1c3Rlci0xfC0=.1\u0022,\n                        \u0022value\u0022: 10000\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \u0022id\u0022: \u0022service_apdex_202307130813_Y2FuYXJ5fHJldmlld3N8Ym9va2luZm98Y2x1c3Rlci0xfC0=.1\u0022,\n                        \u0022value\u0022: 10000\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThe value of the \u0060apdex\u0060 indicator is greater than 9900 (the threshold configured in the \u0060successCondition\u0060 of AnalysisTemplate), so Rollouts will progress smoothly. You can also click Promote manually on the Argo Rollouts Dashboard to promote it, or run the following command:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl argo rollouts promote reviews-rollout -n bookinf\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## Cleaning Up\n\nDelete the deployed ArgoCD Apps and Rollouts:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nargocd app delete -y reviews-rollout\nargocd app delete -y bookinfo-tse-conf\nargocd app delete -y bookinfo-app\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## Principles of Argo Rollouts\n\nWhen integrating with Istio, Argo Rollouts supports traffic splitting based on VirtualService and Subset, as shown in Figure 7.\n\n![Figure 7: Argo Rollouts uses Istio for traffic splitting](f7.svg)\n\nThe table below provides a detailed comparison of these two traffic segmentation methods.\n\n| Type | Applicable Scenario | Resource Object | Principle |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Host-level Traffic Split | Applicable for accessing different versions of services based on hostname; | 2 Services, 1 VirtualService, 1 Rollout; | Rollout injects the rollouts-pod-template-hash label into the ReplicaSet and selects pods with these labels by updating the selector in the Service; |\n| Subset-level Traffic Split | Applicable for accessing different services based on labels; | 1 Service, 1 VirtualService, 1 DestinationRule, and 1 Rollout; | Rollout injects the rollouts-pod-template-hash label into the ReplicaSet and selects pods with these labels by updating the selector in the DestinationRule; |\n\nSubset-based traffic splitting is used in this demo, and Argo Rollouts continuously:\n\n- modify the VirtualService \u0060spec.http[].route[].weight\u0060 to match the current desired canary weight\n- modify the DestinationRule \u0060spec.subsets[].labels\u0060 to contain the \u0060rollouts-pod-template-hash\u0060 label of the canary and stable ReplicaSets\n\nVisit [Argo Rollouts documentation](https:\/\/argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/features\/traffic-management\/istio\/) for details on using Istio for traffic management.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis article introduces how to use the Argo project and Istio to achieve GitOps and canary deployment. First, we use ArgoCD to achieve GitOps, and then use Argo Rollout and SkyWalking to achieve automated canary release. From the demo, we can see that the Istio deployed by TSE is fully compatible with the open-source version. There are many features of TSE worth exploring, visit the [Tetrate website](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/tetrate-service-express\/) for more information.\n\n---\n\n*This blog was originally published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/implementing-gitops-and-canary-deployment-with-argo-project-and-istio\/).*\n', '\/en\/blog\/implementing-gitops-and-canary-deployment-with-argo-project-and-istio\/')">

              <a href="#" onclick="exportToMarkdown('How to Use GraphQL to Query Observability Data from SkyWalking with Postman', 'This article explains how to use GraphQL to query observability data from SkyWalking with Postman. It first introduces GraphQL and SkyWalking, then explains how to set up Postman to send GraphQL queries, and finally provides some example GraphQL queries that can be used to query observability data from SkyWalking.', '\nIn this article, I will explain how to use [GraphQL](https:\/\/graphql.org\/) to query data from [SkyWalking](https:\/\/skywalking.apache.org\/) with [Postman](https:\/\/www.postman.com\/). It includes steps to obtain the bearer token, construct a query to retrieve load metrics for a specific service, and use GraphQL introspection to see the schema of SkyWalking GraphQL APIs. The article also provides references for further information.\n\n## What Is GraphQL?\n\nGraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs developed by Facebook. It provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to traditional REST APIs by allowing clients to specify exactly what data they need and receive only that data in response. With GraphQL, clients can query multiple resources in a single request, reducing the number of roundtrips to the server and improving performance.\n\n## What’s the Difference between GraphQL and REST APIs?\n\nGraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need, while REST APIs require clients to retrieve everything in a resource regardless of whether they need it or not. Additionally, GraphQL allows clients to query multiple resources in a single request, making it more efficient and less chatty than REST APIs.\n\n## How Do I Query Data from SkyWalking?\n\nSkyWalking defines the communication protocol for the query stage. The SkyWalking native UI and CLI use this protocol to consistently fetch data from the backend, without needing to worry about backend updates.\n\nThere are two methods for querying metrics from SkyWalking:\n\n1. [GraphQL APIs](https:\/\/skywalking.apache.org\/docs\/main\/v9.4.0\/en\/api\/query-protocol\/)\n2. [PromQL APIs](https:\/\/skywalking.apache.org\/docs\/main\/v9.4.0\/en\/api\/promql-service\/)\n\nThis article provides a guide on how to use GraphQL to query metrics from SkyWalking. If you are interested in the PromQL APIs, you can refer to the article[ Build Grafana dashboards for Apache SkyWalking — Native PromQL Support](https:\/\/skywalking.apache.org\/blog\/2023-03-17-build-grafana-dashboards-for-apache-skywalking-native-promql-support\/).Continuing with the following steps requires a TSB installation. If you don’t have one and still want to experience using GraphQL to query data in SkyWalking, you can use the free[ demo environment](https:\/\/skywalking.apache.org\/) (username\/password: skywalking\/skywalking) provided by SkyWalking. Log in to the demo website and get a token for queries. Endpoint address for GraphQL queries is http:\/\/demo.skywalking.apache.org\/graphql. The steps to construct the query are the same as described below.\n\n## Observe GraphQL Queries in TSB\n\nBefore we use Postman to construct our own GraphQL query, let’s first observe how TSB obtains data from SkyWalking.\n\n1. Open Chrome DevTools and switch to the Network tab.\n2. Visit the **Organization – Services** tab on the website.\n\nWatch the network request list and right-click on the one of the graphql requests, like in the following image:\n\n![Figure 1: Chrome DevTool](f1.jpg)\n\nThe curl commands you see will look like this. Execute the command in your terminal, and you will get a list of services managed by TSB from SkyWalking.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\ncurl \u0027\u003chttps:\/\/saturn.tetrate.work\/ui\/graphql\u003e\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Accept-Language: en,zh-CN;q=0.9,zh;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.7,zh-TW;q=0.6\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Cache-Control: no-cache\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Client-Timestamp: 1686104776136\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Connection: keep-alive\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Content-Type: application\/json\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Cookie: ...\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Origin: \u003chttps:\/\/saturn.tetrate.work\u003e\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Pragma: no-cache\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Referer: \u003chttps:\/\/saturn.tetrate.work\/mp\/services\u003e\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Request-Id: ...\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027User-Agent: Mozilla\/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/114.0.0.0 Safari\/537.36\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027X-Bridge-Csrf-Token: IOmJszLAqY3TRIUNhTuGu7vQgnfQY1FtgYFm\u002bl\/\u002bMu4EmVQU5T8EaQ7bngkCv4hQ12ZGids\u002bI21pHMdepE9\/qQ==\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027X-Csrf-Token: xTbxZerD3t8N3PaS7nbjKCfxk1Q9dtvvrx4D\u002bIJohHicb0VfB4iAZaP0zh1eXDWctQyCYZWaKLhAYT3M6Drk3A==\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027accept: application\/json\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027sec-ch-ua: \u0022Not.A\/Brand\u0022;v=\u00228\u0022, \u0022Chromium\u0022;v=\u0022114\u0022, \u0022Google Chrome\u0022;v=\u0022114\u0022\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0\u0027 \\\n  -H \u0027sec-ch-ua-platform: \u0022macOS\u0022\u0027 \\\n  --data-raw $\u0027{\u0022query\u0022:\u0022query ServiceRegistryListMetrics(...)}\u0027 \\\n  --compressed\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**Note:** *Some fields in the above example are too long and replaced with dots (…)*.\n\nNext, I will guide you through constructing a query to retrieve the load metrics for a specific service.\n\n## Obtain the Bearer Token\n\nFirstly, you need to obtain the bearer of the website. Log in to TSB UI, click on the user button in the upper right corner, and then click “Show token information”. In the pop-up window, you will see the Bearer Token, as shown in the following image.\n\n![Figure 2: Get the bearer token from the TSB UI](f2.jpg)\n\n**Note:** The validity period of the bearer token is relatively short. When it expires, you need to log in to TSB again to obtain a new token.\n\nWe have already deployed the[ bookinfo application](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/examples\/bookinfo\/) in advance and sent some test traffic. To query the load metrics of reviews using GraphQL in the Postman client, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a new GraphQL request and enter the request URL: \u0060$TSB_ADDRESS\/graphql\u0060\n2. Add the \u0060Authorization\u0060 header with the value\u0060 Bearer $TOKEN\u0060\n\nUse GraphQL Introspection to see the schema of SkyWalking GraphQL APIs. Find and click the \u0060readMetricsValues\u0060 item. You will see the variables on the right side. Fill in the \u0060condition\u0060 and \u0060duration\u0060 items, as shown in the following image.\n\n![Figure 3: Postman query](f3.jpg)\n\nThe variables look like this:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060graphql\nquery ReadMetricsValues {\n    readMetricsValues(condition: {\n    name: \u0022service_cpm\u0022, entity: {scope: Service, serviceName: \u0022reviews\u0022, normal: true}\n  }, duration: {\n    start: \u00222023-06-05 0625\u0022,\n    end: \u00222023-06-05 0627\u0022,\n    step: MINUTE\n  }) {\n        label\n        values {\n            values {\n                id\n                value\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nClick the **Query** button to get the result. It should look similar to this:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060json\n{\n    \u0022data\u0022: {\n        \u0022readMetricsValues\u0022: {\n            \u0022label\u0022: null,\n            \u0022values\u0022: {\n                \u0022values\u0022: [\n                    {\n                        \u0022id\u0022: \u0022service_cpm_202306050625_cmV2aWV3cw==.1\u0022,\n                        \u0022value\u0022: 0\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \u0022id\u0022: \u0022service_cpm_202306050626_cmV2aWV3cw==.1\u0022,\n                        \u0022value\u0022: 0\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \u0022id\u0022: \u0022service_cpm_202306050627_cmV2aWV3cw==.1\u0022,\n                        \u0022value\u0022: 0\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThe above is using the SkyWalking Demo environment to test GraphQL queries. GraphQL query support is also provided in TSE, and the endpoint address is \u0060https:\/\/$TSB_SERVER\/graphql\u0060.\n\n**Note:** The query endpoint here is different from what we see in DevTool. The GraphQL query endpoint specific to the TSB UI is \u0060https:\/\/$TSB_SERVER\/ui\/graphql\u0060.For details about the SkyWalking GraphQL Query Protocol, please refer to[ GitHub](https:\/\/github.com\/apache\/skywalking-query-protocol\/tree\/master).\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this article, I have introduced how to use the GraphQL query protocol in Postman to query data in SkyWalking. You can construct your own query conditions based on the GraphQL schema of SkyWalking. This feature is also available in TSB\/TSE.\n\n## References\n\n- https:\/\/github.com\/apache\/skywalking-query-protocol\n- [SkyWalking Website](https:\/\/skywalking.apache.org\/)\n\n---\n\n*This blog was originally published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/what-is-tproxy-and-how-does-it-work\/).*\n', '\/en\/blog\/how-to-use-graphql-to-query-observability-data-from-skywalking-with-postman\/')">

How do we determine the service paths and nodes a call goes through to help us troubleshoot the problem? This is where distributed tracing comes into play.\n\nThis article covers:\n\n- How distributed tracing works\n- How to choose distributed tracing software\n- How to use distributed tracing in Istio\n- How to view distributed tracing data using Bookinfo and SkyWalking as examples\n\n## Distributed Tracing Basics\n\nDistributed tracing is a method for tracing requests in a distributed system to help users better understand, control, and optimize distributed systems. There are two concepts used in distributed tracing: TraceID and SpanID. You can see them in Figure 1 below.\n\n- **TraceID** is a globally unique ID that identifies the trace information of a request. All traces of a request belong to the same TraceID, and the TraceID remains constant throughout the trace of the request.\n- **SpanID** is a locally unique ID that identifies a request’s trace information at a certain time. A request generates different SpanIDs at different periods, and SpanIDs are used to distinguish trace information for a request at different periods.\n\nTraceID and SpanID are the basis of distributed tracing. They provide a uniform identifier for request tracing in distributed systems and facilitate users’ ability to query, manage, and analyze the trace information of requests.\n\n![Figure 1: Trace and span](basic.svg)\n\nThe following is the process of distributed tracing:\n\n- When a system receives a request, the distributed tracing system assigns a TraceID to the request, which is used to chain together the entire chain of invocations.\n- The distributed trace system generates a SpanID and ParentID for each service call within the system for the request, which is used to record the parent-child relationship of the call; a Span without a ParentID is used as the entry point of the call chain.\n- TraceID and SpanID are to be passed during each service call.\n- When viewing a distributed trace, query the full process of a particular request by TraceID.\n\n## How Istio Implements Distributed Tracing\n\nIstio’s distributed tracing is based on information collected by the Envoy proxy in the data plane. After a service request is intercepted by Envoy, Envoy adds tracing information as headers to the request forwarded to the destination workload. The following headers are relevant for distributed tracing:\n\n- As TraceID: x-request-id\n- Used to establish parent-child relationships for Span in the LightStep trace: x-ot-span-context\u003c\/li\n- Used for Zipkin, also for Jaeger, SkyWalking, see [b3-propagation](https:\/\/github.com\/openzipkin\/b3-propagation):\n  - *x-b3-traceid*\n  - *x-b3-traceid*\n  - *x-b3-spanid*\n  - *x-b3-parentspanid*\n  - *x-b3-sampled*\n  - *x-b3-flags*\n  - *b3*\n- For Datadog:\n  - *x-datadog-trace-id*\n  - *x-datadog-parent-id*\n  - *x-datadog-sampling-priority*\n- For SkyWalking: *sw8*\n- For AWS X-Ray: *x-amzn-trace-id*\n\nFor more information on how to use these headers, please see the [Envoy documentation](https:\/\/www.envoyproxy.io\/docs\/envoy\/latest\/configuration\/http\/http_conn_man\/headers).\n\nRegardless of the language of your application, Envoy will generate the appropriate tracing headers for you at the Ingress Gateway and forward these headers to the upstream cluster. However, in order to utilize the distributed tracing feature, you must modify your application code to attach the tracing headers to upstream requests. Since neither the service mesh nor the application can automatically propagate these headers, you can integrate the agent for distributed tracing into the application or manually propagate these headers in the application code itself. Once the tracing headers are propagated to all upstream requests, Envoy will send the tracing data to the tracer’s back-end processing, and then you can view the tracing data in the UI.\n\nFor example, look at the code of the Productpage service in the [Bookinfo application](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/examples\/bookinfo\/). You can see that it integrates the Jaeger client library and synchronizes the header generated by Envoy with the HTTP requests to the Details and Reviews services in the *getForwardHeaders (request)* function.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060python\ndef getForwardHeaders(request):\n    headers = {}\n\n    # Using Jaeger agent to get the x-b3-* headers\n    span = get_current_span()\n    carrier = {}\n    tracer.inject(\n        span_context=span.context,\n        format=Format.HTTP_HEADERS,\n        carrier=carrier)\n\n    headers.update(carrier)\n\n    # Dealing with the non x-b3-* header manually\n    if \u0027user\u0027 in session:\n        headers[\u0027end-user\u0027] = session[\u0027user\u0027]\n    incoming_headers = [\n        \u0027x-request-id\u0027,\n        \u0027x-ot-span-context\u0027,\n        \u0027x-datadog-trace-id\u0027,\n        \u0027x-datadog-parent-id\u0027,\n        \u0027x-datadog-sampling-priority\u0027,\n        \u0027traceparent\u0027,\n        \u0027tracestate\u0027,\n        \u0027x-cloud-trace-context\u0027,\n        \u0027grpc-trace-bin\u0027,\n        \u0027sw8\u0027,\n        \u0027user-agent\u0027,\n        \u0027cookie\u0027,\n        \u0027authorization\u0027,\n        \u0027jwt\u0027,\n    ]\n\n    for ihdr in incoming_headers:\n        val = request.headers.get(ihdr)\n        if val is not None:\n            headers[ihdr] = val\n\n    return headers\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nFor more information, the [Istio documentation](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/about\/faq\/#distributed-tracing) provides answers to frequently asked questions about distributed tracing in Istio.\n\n## How to Choose A Distributed Tracing System\n\nDistributed tracing systems are similar in principle. There are many such systems on the market, such as [Apache SkyWalking](https:\/\/github.com\/apache\/skywalking), [Jaeger](https:\/\/github.com\/jaegertracing\/jaeger), [Zipkin](https:\/\/github.com\/openzipkin\/zipkin\/), Lightstep, [Pinpoint](https:\/\/github.com\/pinpoint-apm\/pinpoint), and so on. For our purposes here, we will choose three of them and compare them in several dimensions. Here are our inclusion criteria:\n\n- They are currently the most popular open-source distributed tracing systems.\n- All are based on the OpenTracing specification.\n- They support integration with Istio and Envoy.\n\n| Items               | Apache SkyWalking                                            | Jaeger                                       | Zipkin                                       |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| Implementations     | Language-based probes, service mesh probes, eBPF agent, third-party instrumental libraries (Zipkin currently supported) | Language-based probes                        | Language-based probes                        |\n| Database            | ES, H2, MySQL, TiDB, Sharding-sphere, BanyanDB               | ES, MySQL, Cassandra, Memory                 | ES, MySQL, Cassandra, Memory                 |\n| Supported Languages | Java, Rust, PHP, NodeJS, Go, Python, C\u002b\u002b, .Net, Lua          | Java, Go, Python, NodeJS, C#, PHP, Ruby, C\u002b\u002b | Java, Go, Python, NodeJS, C#, PHP, Ruby, C\u002b\u002b |\n| Initiator           | Personal                                                     | Uber                                         | Twitter                                      |\n| Governance          | Apache Foundation                                            | CNCF                                         | CNCF                                         |\n| Version             | 9.3.0                                                        | 1.39.0                                       | 2.23.19                                      |\n| Stars               | 20.9k                                                        | 16.8k                                        | 15.8k                                        |\n\nAlthough Apache SkyWalking’s agent does not support as many languages as Jaeger and Zipkin, SkyWalking’s implementation is richer and compatible with Jaeger and Zipkin trace data, and development is more active, so it is one of the best choices for building a telemetry platform.\n\n## Demo\n\nRefer to the [Istio documentation](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/tasks\/observability\/distributed-tracing\/skywalking\/) to install and configure Apache SkyWalking.\n\n### Environment Description\n\nThe following is the environment for our demo:\n\n- Kubernetes 1.24.5\n- Istio 1.16\n- SkyWalking 9.1.0\n\n### Install Istio\n\nBefore installing Istio, you can check the environment for any problems:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\n$ istioctl experimental precheck\n✔ No issues found when checking the cluster. Istio is safe to install or upgrade!\n  To get started, check out https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/setup\/getting-started\/\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThen install Istio and configure the destination for sending tracing messages as SkyWalking:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\n# Initial Istio Operator\nistioctl operator init\n# Configure tracing destination\nkubectl apply -f - \u003c\u003cEOF\napiVersion: install.istio.io\/v1alpha1\nkind: IstioOperator\nmetadata:\n  namespace: istio-system\n  name: istio-with-skywalking\nspec:\n  meshConfig:\n    defaultProviders:\n      tracing:\n      - \u0022skywalking\u0022\n    enableTracing: true\n    extensionProviders:\n    - name: \u0022skywalking\u0022\n      skywalking:\n        service: tracing.istio-system.svc.cluster.local\n        port: 11800\nEOF\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## Deploy Apache SkyWalking\n\nIstio 1.16 supports distributed tracing using Apache SkyWalking. Install SkyWalking by executing the following code:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl apply -f \nhttps:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/istio\/istio\/release-1.16\/samples\/addons\/extras\/skywalking.yaml\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nIt will install the following components under the *istio-system* namespace:\n\n- SkyWalking Observability Analysis Platform (OAP): Used to receive trace data, supports SkyWalking native data formats, Zipkin v1 and v2 and Jaeger format.\n- UI: Used to query distributed trace data.\n\nFor more information about SkyWalking, please refer to the SkyWalking documentation.\n\n## Deploy the Bookinfo Application\n\nExecute the following command to install the bookinfo application:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled\nkubectl apply -f samples\/bookinfo\/platform\/kube\/bookinfo.yaml\nkubectl apply -f samples\/bookinfo\/networking\/bookinfo-gateway.yaml\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nLaunch the SkyWalking UI:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nistioctl dashboard skywalking\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nFigure 2 shows all the services available in the bookinfo application:\n\n![Figure 2: SkyWalking General Service page](general-service.jpg)\n\nYou can also see information about instances, endpoints, topology, tracing, etc. For example, Figure 3 shows the service topology of the bookinfo application:\n\n![Figure 3: Topology diagram of the Bookinfo application](topology.jpg)\n\nTracing views in SkyWalking can be displayed in a variety of formats, including list, tree, table, and statistics. See Figure 4:\n\n![Figure 4: SkyWalking General Service trace supports multiple display formats](gs-styles.jpg)\n\nTo facilitate our examination, set the sampling rate of the trace to 100%:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl apply -f - \u003c\u003cEOF\napiVersion: telemetry.istio.io\/v1alpha1\nkind: Telemetry\nmetadata:\n  name: mesh-default\n  namespace: istio-system\nspec:\n  tracing:\n  - randomSamplingPercentage: 100.00\nEOF\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n\u003e **Important:** *It’s generally not good practice to set the sampling rate to 100% in a production environment. To avoid the overhead of generating too many trace logs in production, please adjust the sampling strategy (sampling percentage).*\n\n## Uninstall\n\nAfter experimenting, uninstall Istio and SkyWalking by executing the following command.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nsamples\/bookinfo\/platform\/kube\/cleanup.sh\nistioctl unintall --purge\nkubectl delete namespace istio-system\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## Understanding the Bookinfo Tracing Information\n\nNavigate to the General Service tab in the Apache SkyWalking UI, and you can see the trace information for the most recent *istio-ingressgateway* service, as shown in Figure 5. Click on each span to see the details.\n\n![Figure 5: The table view shows the basic information about each span.](span-table.jpg)\n\nSwitching to the list view, you can see the execution order and duration of each span, as shown in Figure 6:\n\n![Figure 6: List display](trace-list.jpg)\n\nYou might want to know why such a straightforward application generates so much span data. Because after we inject the Envoy proxy into the pod, every request between services will be intercepted and processed by Envoy, as shown in Figure 7:\n\n![Figure 7: Envoy intercepts requests to generate a span](span.svg)\n\nThe tracing process is shown in Figure 8:\n\n![Figure 8: Trace of the Bookinfo application](bookinfo-spans-with-time.svg)\n\nWe give each span a label with a serial number, and the time taken is indicated in parentheses. For illustration purposes, we have summarized all spans in the table below.\n\n| No.  | Endpoint     | Total Duration (ms) | Component Duration (ms) | Current Service      | Description                                 |\n| ---- | ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |\n| 1    | \/productpage | 190                 | 0                       | istio-ingressgateway | Envoy Outbound                              |\n| 2    | \/productpage | 190                 | 1                       | istio-ingressgateway | Ingress -\u003e Productpage network transmission |\n| 3    | \/productpage | 189                 | 1                       | productpage          | Envoy Inbound                               |\n| 4    | \/productpage | 188                 | 21                      | productpage          | Application internal processing             |\n| 5    | \/details\/0   | 8                   | 1                       | productpage          | Envoy Outbound                              |\n| 6    | \/details\/0   | 7                   | 3                       | productpage          | Productpage -\u003e Details network transmission |\n| 7    | \/details\/0   | 4                   | 0                       | details              | Envoy Inbound                               |\n| 8    | \/details\/0   | 4                   | 4                       | details              | Application internal processing             |\n| 9    | \/reviews\/0   | 159                 | 0                       | productpage          | Envoy Outbound                              |\n| 10   | \/reviews\/0   | 159                 | 14                      | productpage          | Productpage -\u003e Reviews network transmission |\n| 11   | \/reviews\/0   | 145                 | 1                       | reviews              | Envoy Inbound                               |\n| 12   | \/reviews\/0   | 144                 | 109                     | reviews              | Application internal processing             |\n| 13   | \/ratings\/0   | 35                  | 2                       | reviews              | Envoy Outbound                              |\n| 14   | \/ratings\/0   | 33                  | 16                      | reviews              | Reviews -\u003e Ratings network transmission     |\n| 15   | \/ratings\/0   | 17                  | 1                       | ratings              | Envoy Inbound                               |\n| 16   | \/ratings\/0   | 16                  | 16                      | ratings              | Application internal processing             |\n\nFrom the above information, it can be seen that:\n\n- The total time consumed for this request is 190 ms.\n- In Istio sidecar mode, each traffic flow in and out of the application container must pass through the Envoy proxy once, each time taking 0 to 2 ms.\n- Network requests between Pods take between 1 and 16ms.\n- This is because the data itself has errors and the start time of the Span is not necessarily equal to the end time of the parent Span.\n- We can see that the most time-consuming part is the Reviews application, which takes 109 ms so that we can optimize it for that application.\n\n## Summary\n\nDistributed tracing is an indispensable tool for analyzing performance and troubleshooting modern distributed applications. In this tutorial, we’ve seen how, with just a few minor changes to your application code to propagate tracing headers, Istio makes distributed tracing simple to use. We’ve also reviewed [Apache SkyWalking](https:\/\/skywalking.apache.org\/) as one of the best distributed tracing systems that Istio supports. It is a fully functional platform for cloud native application analytics, with features such as metrics and log collection, alerting, Kubernetes monitoring, [service mesh performance diagnosis using eBPF](https:\/\/skywalking.apache.org\/blog\/diagnose-service-mesh-network-performance-with-ebpf\/), and more.\n\n---\n\nIf you’re new to service mesh and Kubernetes security, we have a bunch of free online courses [available at Tetrate Academy](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/academy) that will quickly get you up to speed with Istio and Envoy.\n\nIf you’re looking for a fast way to get to production with Istio, check out [Tetrate Istio Distribution (TID)](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/tid). TID is Tetrate’s hardened, fully upstream Istio distribution, with FIPS-verified builds and support available. It’s a great way to get started with Istio knowing you have a trusted distribution to begin with, have an expert team supporting you, and also have the option to get to FIPS compliance quickly if you need to.\n\nOnce you have Istio up and running, you will probably need simpler ways to manage and secure your services beyond what’s available in Istio, that’s where Tetrate Service Bridge comes in. You can learn more about how Tetrate Service Bridge makes service mesh more secure, manageable, and resilient [here](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/tsb), or [contact us for a quick demo](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/contact).\n\n*This blog was originally published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/how-to-use-skywalking-for-distributed-tracing-in-istio\/).*\n', '\/en\/blog\/distributed-tracing-with-skywalking-in-istio\/')">
