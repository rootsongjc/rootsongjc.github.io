&lt;h2 id=&#34;istio-cilium-and-service-mesh&#34;&gt;Istio, Cilium, and Service Mesh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io&#34; title=&#34;Istio&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio&lt;/a&gt;
 and Service Mesh were hot topics, showcasing the latest developments and applications of these technologies within the cloud-native ecosystem. The conference covered various areas, including infrastructure optimization, data locality, distributed tracing, and multi-cluster deployment, reflecting the widespread attention and continuous innovation in Service Mesh technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-locality-and-global-request-routing&#34;&gt;Data Locality and Global Request Routing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthur Busser and Baudouin Herlicq from Pigment shared how Kubernetes and Istio can fulfill data locality requirements. They introduced methods using Istio for request routing based on custom headers, crucial for meeting data residency requirements such as GDPR and CCPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;distributed-tracing-and-enhanced-observability&#34;&gt;Distributed Tracing and Enhanced Observability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Detsicas from ThousandEyes (part of Cisco) discussed configuring Istio with OpenTelemetry for effective distributed tracing, providing valuable visibility into microservices ecosystems for problem diagnosis and performance optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;multi-cluster-deployment-and-traffic-management&#34;&gt;Multi-cluster Deployment and Traffic Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haiwen Zhang and Yongxi Zhang from China Mobile introduced a new approach to simplify Istio multi-cluster deployment. This method utilizes a globally unique Istio control plane, achieving global service discovery through the main cluster&amp;rsquo;s Apiserver, automatically connecting the container networks of multiple clusters, and providing direct network connectivity for Pods. They highlighted the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kosmos-io/kosmos&#34; title=&#34;Kosmos project&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Kosmos project&lt;/a&gt;
, offering a new solution to simplify service mesh deployment and management in multi-cluster environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ameer Abbas and John Howard from Google discussed building 99.99% reliability services with infrastructure reliability at 99.9%. They proposed a series of application architecture prototypes (Archetypes) to design and implement highly reliable multi-cluster applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototype 1: Active-Passive Zones&lt;/strong&gt; - Deploy all services in two zones of a single region, using read-only replicas of SQL databases, with fault tolerance within the zone achieved through L4 load balancers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototype 2: Multi-Zonal&lt;/strong&gt; - Deploy all services in three zones of a single region, using highly available SQL databases, with fault tolerance within the zone achieved through global or zonal load balancers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototype 3: Active-Passive Region&lt;/strong&gt; - Deploy all services in three zones of two regions, using SQL databases replicated across regions, with fault tolerance between regions achieved through DNS and load balancers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototype 4: Isolated Regions&lt;/strong&gt; - Deploy all services in three zones of two regions, using global databases like Spanner or CockroachDB, with fault tolerance between regions achieved through zonal load balancers and DNS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototype 5: Global&lt;/strong&gt; - Deploy all services in three zones of two or more regions, using global databases like Spanner or CockroachDB, with fault tolerance achieved globally through global load balancers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;security-and-zero-trust-architecture&#34;&gt;Security and Zero Trust Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several sessions emphasized the importance of securing Istio in production environments. Discussions led by Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Niranjan Shankar focused on steps and strategies to reinforce Istio&amp;rsquo;s security using network policies, third-party Kubernetes tools, and cloud-provided security services to build zero trust and defense-in-depth architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;infrastructure-compatibility-and-future-of-ambient-mesh&#34;&gt;Infrastructure Compatibility and Future of Ambient Mesh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Leggett and Yuval Kohavi introduced an innovative approach to enable Istio&amp;rsquo;s Ambient mode to support any Kubernetes CNI, detailed in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io/latest/zh/blog/2024/inpod-traffic-redirection-ambient/&#34; title=&#34;Istio blog&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Istio blog&lt;/a&gt;
. This advancement addresses the limited CNI support in Ambient mesh, allowing applications to be included in Ambient mode without restarting Pods, thus simplifying operations and reducing infrastructure costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Istio community announced that Ambient mode will become beta in the upcoming Istio 1.22 release, as described in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cncf.io/blog/2024/03/19/istio-announces-the-beta-release-of-ambient-mode/&#34; title=&#34;CNCF blog&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CNCF blog&lt;/a&gt;
. Multiple presentations and discussions focused on the future of Istio Ambient Mesh, especially its potential to simplify workload operations and reduce infrastructure costs. The introduction of Istio Ambient Mesh signals a new direction for service mesh technology, offering a data plane architecture without sidecars, providing higher performance and lower resource consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;innovation-in-sidecar-less-service-mesh&#34;&gt;Innovation in Sidecar-less Service Mesh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions at KubeCon EU 2024 evaluated and compared the pros and cons of using sidecar-based and sidecar-less (such as Istio&amp;rsquo;s Ambient Mesh) service mesh models. Christian Posta&amp;rsquo;s in-depth analysis of design decisions and trade-offs between Cilium and Istio in implementing sidecar-less service mesh highlighted the potential of this model in improving performance, reducing resource consumption, and simplifying operational tasks. By analyzing the transition from Istio to Cilium at The New York Times, it further demonstrated the effectiveness of the sidecar-less model in handling complex, multi-region service meshes, while also pointing out challenges and implementation considerations in this transition. These discussions foreshadowed the potential evolution of service mesh technology towards more flexible and efficient architectures, where the sidecar-less approach may become a key strategy for optimizing the performance and resource utilization of cloud-native applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;intersection-of-cilium-and-service-mesh&#34;&gt;Intersection of Cilium and Service Mesh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cilium.io&#34; title=&#34;Cilium&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Cilium&lt;/a&gt;
 was widely discussed at KubeCon EU 2024. As a technology based on eBPF, Cilium is not only seen as an efficient Container Network Interface (CNI) but also demonstrates strong potential in the service mesh domain. Through presentations by Isovalent and other organizations, Cilium was showcased as an advanced solution for connecting, observing, and securing service mesh. In particular, Cilium&amp;rsquo;s sidecar-less service mesh implementation was considered a future direction, leveraging eBPF technology to achieve secure communication and fine-grained traffic management among microservices without adding the burden of traditional sidecar proxies. Additionally, Cilium&amp;rsquo;s extensibility beyond service mesh, such as in multi-cloud networking and load balancing, highlights its position as a core component of the cloud-native ecosystem. These discussions and case studies of Cilium demonstrate its significant role in driving innovation in service mesh and cloud-native technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cloud-native-trends&#34;&gt;Cloud Native Trends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several major trends in the cloud-native field:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Sustainability and Environmental Awareness&lt;/strong&gt;: For example, Deutsche Bahn integrating developers into its infrastructure greening process, emphasizing the increasing consideration of environmental factors in designing and operating cloud-native solutions. This reflects a trend where companies are increasingly considering environmental factors while pursuing technological advancements, achieving sustainable technology ecosystems through green computing and energy efficiency optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration of Artificial Intelligence with Cloud-Native Technologies&lt;/strong&gt;: Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming the next major challenge for Kubernetes and the cloud-native ecosystem. Discussions on Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s AI strategy, CNCF&amp;rsquo;s efforts to standardize AI in the cloud-native future, and updates on various tools and platforms integrating AI and machine learning (ML) highlight this trend. This trend indicates that seamlessly integrating&lt;/p&gt;
