Its core idea is to remove the Sidecar proxy to reduce resource overhead and operational complexity.\n\nIn this article, I’ll explain Ambient Mode\u0027s background, core components, traffic routing mechanisms, and a comparison with the existing Sidecar model. The goal is to help you evaluate this new feature and confidently adopt it.\n\n[Click here to view the slides](\/en\/slide\/beyond-sidecar\/).\n\n## Why Care About Ambient Mode?\n\nLet’s start with a question: why should we care about—or even consider adopting—this new mode? Sidecar proxies have been working well in service meshes for years, so why remove them now?\n\nTo answer that, let’s look at some of the challenges service meshes currently face.\n\n### Challenges with Service Mesh\n\n- **Resource overhead** and **operational complexity** introduced by sidecar proxies \n- **Upgrading** or **restarting** Envoy often requires restarting all Pods \n- Growing demand for **high performance** and **lower costs**\n\n\u003e **Thought exercise**: Is there a way to retain the core capabilities of a service mesh—security, observability, traffic control—while reducing the per-Pod intrusion and extra resource consumption?\n\n### Common Service Mesh Deployment Models\n\n![Proxy Locations](proxy-location.svg)\n\nThe architecture of service meshes has long been exploring different proxy deployment strategies, such as:\n\n- **Sidecar**: Runs an Envoy proxy inside each Pod\n- **Ambient**: Moves the proxy out of Pods to the node level (which this post focuses on)\n- **Cilium Mesh**: Uses eBPF in the kernel space for L4, combined with Envoy for L7 capabilities\n- **gRPC**: Embeds mesh functionality directly into application SDKs\n\nEach of these models has trade-offs in terms of functionality, security, performance, and operational complexity. **Istio Ambient Mode** is a new attempt to address the Sidecar model’s overhead and operational burdens.\n\n### The Birth of Ambient Mode\n\n- A next-generation Istio architecture that **removes the Sidecar**, using **ztunnel \u002b Waypoint Proxy** to simplify the data plane\n- Saves resources and reduces operational complexity\n- Still supports **mTLS** and **policy enforcement**, with **Waypoint Proxy** optionally providing L7 capabilities\n\n![Deployment Model Quadrants](istio-data-plane-deployment-modes.svg)\n\nThe following table provides a quick comparison of some common service mesh deployment models:\n\n| **Mode**         | **Security**                         | **Efficiency**        | **Manageability**            | **Performance**                          |\n| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |\n| **Sidecar**       | High isolation via per-Pod proxy     | High resource usage   | Centralized but complex      | Adds some latency                        |\n| **Ambient**       | Security via ztunnel (still evolving) | More efficient, shared | Easier to manage, still maturing | Good; cross-AZ traffic may add overhead |\n| **Cilium mesh**   | Moderate, kernel-based with eBPF     | Kernel-level efficiency | Complex to configure         | Depends on use case                      |\n| **gRPC**          | App-integrated, depends on the app   | Efficient              | Complex upgrade management    | Low latency, ideal for real-time use     |\n\n## Core Concepts of Istio Ambient Mode\n\nLet’s now move into the second part of our discussion, where we’ll explore the core components of Ambient Mode, including **ztunnel**, **Waypoint Proxy**, and the role of **Istio CNI**.\n\n### Key Components of Ambient Mode\n\n1. **ztunnel (L4)**\n   - Runs as a node-level proxy\n   - Responsible for **transparent traffic interception** and **mTLS encryption**\n   - Handles most traffic that only requires L4 forwarding\n\n2. **Waypoint Proxy (L7)**\n   - Optionally deployed (configurable by namespace, service, or pod granularity)\n   - Handles advanced functionality like **HTTP\/gRPC authentication, routing, and observability**\n\n3. **Istio CNI**\n   - Replaces the \u0060istio-init\u0060 container and handles traffic redirection\n   - Supports both **Sidecar** and **Ambient** modes\n   - Enables traffic redirection in **unprivileged mode** for enhanced security\n\n### Overview of Ambient Mode Architecture\n\n![Istio Ambient Mode Architecture](istio-ambient-layers.svg)\n\nIn Ambient Mode, the Istio data plane is split into two layers:\n\n1. **Security Layer (ztunnel)**: A lightweight L4 proxy is deployed on each node\n2. **Optional L7 Layer (Waypoint Proxy)**: Deployed only when HTTP\/gRPC proxying is needed\n\nThe **control plane** is still managed by **Istiod**, which distributes configurations and certificates to both ztunnel and Waypoint proxies.\n\n### Deployment Strategies for Waypoint Proxy\n\n- **Namespace-level** (default): Applies to all workloads in the namespace\n- **Service-level**: For services that require L7 processing only\n- **Pod-level**: Offers fine-grained control\n- **Cross-namespace**: Enables sharing via Gateway resources\n\n### Istio CNI\n\n- **Traffic Interception**: Replaces the \u0060istio-init\u0060 container, simplifying the installation process\n- **Dual-mode Support**: Compatible with both **Sidecar** and **Ambient** modes\n- **Unprivileged Mode Compatibility**: Enables traffic redirection for Pods running without elevated privileges\n- **CNI Chaining**: Adds Istio CNI as an additional plugin in the existing CNI configuration\n- **In-Pod Traffic Redirection (Ambient Mode)**:\n  - Uses \u0060iptables REDIRECT\u0060 rules inside the Pod’s network namespace\n  - Creates a local socket within the Pod to intercept and proxy traffic\n\nThe following diagram illustrates how Istio CNI integrates with Kubernetes network plugins like Calico or Cilium. Istio CNI modifies the node’s CNI configuration by appending itself to the CNI chain. After Kubernetes assigns a Pod IP, Istio CNI executes its interception logic and injects traffic redirection rules into the Pod’s network namespace.\n\nIt applies different \u0060iptables\u0060 rules depending on whether the Pod runs in Sidecar or Ambient mode, forming a chained CNI workflow that complements—rather than conflicts with—the existing network policies.\n\n![How Istio CNI Works](istio-cni.svg)\n\n### How the Istio CNI Plugin Works\n\nThe following diagram illustrates in detail what the Istio CNI does when a Pod starts:\n\n![How the Istio CNI Plugin Works](istio-cni-diagram.svg)\n\n1. It enters the Pod’s network namespace and creates a set of iptables rules to redirect traffic to the socket where **ztunnel** is listening.\n2. There’s no longer a need to inject an init container into each Pod, nor are elevated privileges required. This results in a cleaner and more secure deployment.\n3. **ztunnel** creates a socket inside each Pod’s network namespace, and does so for every Pod on the node.\n\n## Traffic Flow and Core Mechanisms\n\nAfter understanding the components, let’s dive into the heart of Ambient Mode: **the traffic path**. How do zTunnel and Waypoint intercept and forward traffic? We\u0027ll examine this through the lens of transparent traffic interception and the HBONE protocol.\n\n### Transparent Traffic Interception\n\nIn Ambient Mode, **Istio CNI** injects iptables rules into each Pod\u0027s network namespace to **transparently intercept outbound traffic** and redirect it to the local **ztunnel** process on the node. zTunnel then decides whether to forward traffic at L4 or send it to the **Waypoint Proxy** for L7 processing.\n\nAs shown in the diagram, when Kubelet starts a Pod on the node, this event is observed by the Istio CNI Agent. The agent enters the Pod’s network namespace, sets up iptables rules to redirect traffic to a local socket, and passes the Pod’s **file descriptor (FD)** to zTunnel. Once zTunnel receives the FD, it creates a socket within the Pod’s namespace.\n\nWhen the Pod sends traffic, it normally would go directly to the destination address. But because of the iptables rules, the traffic is intercepted and redirected to the local zTunnel process. zTunnel then determines whether the traffic needs L7 processing via Waypoint:\n\n- If not, it encrypts and forwards the traffic at **L4** directly to the destination Pod.\n- If **L7** functionality is needed (e.g., for authentication), it tunnels the traffic to the **Waypoint Proxy**.\n\n![Transparent Traffic Interception](transparent-traffic-interception.svg)\n\n### Packet Lifecycle Overview\n\n1. **Pod → ztunnel**: Traffic from the Pod is intercepted by the CNI and redirected to the local ztunnel on the same node.\n2. **ztunnel**: Resolves the destination address and applies mTLS encryption.\n3. **(If L7 policy is needed) ztunnel → Waypoint Proxy**: Handles HTTP authentication, routing, etc.\n4. **Waypoint Proxy**: After L7 processing, traffic is sent back to ztunnel.\n5. **ztunnel**: Decapsulates or forwards the traffic to the destination node’s ztunnel.\n6. **To the target Pod**: The destination ztunnel finally delivers the traffic to the target Pod.\n\n### The HBONE Protocol\n\nIn Ambient Mode, ztunnel and Waypoint Proxy use the **HBONE (HTTP\/2 \u002b CONNECT)** protocol to establish a secure tunnel. This enables **mTLS encryption** and multiplexing, reducing connection overhead and simplifying proxy forwarding logic.\n\n![HBONE Protocol](hbone-packet.svg)\n\nBelow is a simplified example of an HBONE CONNECT request, which uses headers like \u0060x-envoy-original-dst-host\u0060 and \u0060x-istio-auth-userinfo\u0060 to pass routing and authentication context:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060text\n:method: CONNECT\n:scheme: https\n:authority: Pod_B_IP:9080\n:path: \/api\/v1\/users?id=123\nx-envoy-original-dst-host: Pod_B_IP:9080\nx-forwarded-proto: hbone\nx-istio-attributes: ...\n...\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nIn this example, assume ztunnel A is sending traffic to node B. The outer TCP connection is actually from \u0060ztunnel_A_IP:52368\u0060 to \u0060Node_B_IP:15008\u0060, where port 15008 is the HBONE listener on the destination node.\n\nAt the HTTP\/2 layer, a CONNECT request is initiated. The \u0060:authority\u0060 field shows \u0060Pod_B_IP:9080\u0060, indicating the actual destination port of Pod B. The \u0060x-envoy-original-dst-host\u0060 header carries the same target.\n\nYou’ll also notice custom headers like \u0060x-forwarded-proto\u0060 and \u0060x-istio-attributes\u0060, which carry routing context and security metadata for the receiving ztunnel or downstream proxy.\n\nThink of this as an “inner tunnel” built on top of HTTP\/2 CONNECT: the application-layer request (e.g., \u0060\/api\/v1\/users?id=123\u0060) is encapsulated inside, then unpacked by ztunnel B and forwarded to Pod B.\n\nThis entire process is transparent to the application. But by inspecting the CONNECT headers, we gain insight into how Ambient Mode performs traffic routing and identity verification at the HTTP\/2 layer. This flexibility makes HBONE a more adaptable alternative to traditional Sidecar-to-Sidecar communication, especially for implementing mTLS and L7 extensions.\n\n### Encrypted Traffic on the Same Node\n\nIf the source Pod and destination Pod happen to be on the same node, traffic goes through the ztunnel\u0027s L4 encryption path.\n\nAs shown here, ztunnel is deployed as a DaemonSet on each node and runs in the host network, sharing the host’s network namespace. Istio CNI intercepts the Pod\u0027s outbound traffic and redirects it to ztunnel’s port 15001. When both the source and destination Pods are on the same node, ztunnel performs encryption and decryption internally and directly forwards the traffic to the destination Pod.\n\nIf L7 traffic handling is required (e.g., authentication), ztunnel establishes an HBONE tunnel with the Waypoint proxy, and traffic is routed through the Waypoint before reaching the destination Pod.\n\n![Encrypted Traffic on the Same Node](ambient-traffic-on-the-same-node.svg)\n\n### Encrypted Traffic Across Nodes (L4)\n\nThis is the cross-node scenario, which is also the most common case:\n\nThe source node’s ztunnel encrypts the traffic via an HBONE tunnel and sends it to the destination node’s ztunnel. The destination ztunnel decapsulates the traffic and forwards it as plaintext to the destination Pod. As long as the traffic remains purely L4 and does not require L7 features, it avoids additional hops through a Waypoint proxy—reducing the proxy chain and improving efficiency.\n\n![Encrypted Traffic Across Nodes (L4)](ambient-traffic-on-the-same-node-l4.svg)\n\n### Encrypted Traffic Across Nodes (L7)\n\nWhen L7 processing is required, the traffic passes through an additional Waypoint proxy, following this flow:\n\n- The source ztunnel tunnels the traffic to the Waypoint proxy.\n- The Waypoint handles L7 logic like authentication and routing.\n- The Waypoint re-tunnels the traffic using HBONE to the destination ztunnel.\n- The destination ztunnel decapsulates the traffic and delivers it to the destination Pod.\n\n![Encrypted Traffic Across Nodes (L7)](ambient-traffic-on-the-same-node-l7.svg)\n\nThis process adds one extra proxy hop compared to L4-only traffic, but the benefit is that only traffic requiring L7 handling goes through this additional step—reducing unnecessary overhead.\n\n### Catch-All Traffic (Preventing Traffic Escape)\n\nFor traffic originating outside the Istio mesh that tries to access a Pod directly via its IP and port, Istio still needs to ensure such traffic is intercepted and managed by ztunnel to prevent it from bypassing the mesh.\n\nIf the traffic targets an application port, ztunnel checks whether the packet includes the \u00600x539\u0060 mark. If not, it redirects the traffic to port \u006015006\u0060, a plaintext port monitored by ztunnel. After processing, ztunnel adds the \u00600x539\u0060 mark and forwards it to the application port.\n\nIf the destination port is \u006015008\u0060, the packet is treated as HBONE traffic and directly handled by ztunnel.\n\n![Non-Mesh Traffic Routed into the Mesh](non-istio-mesh-pod-taffic-go-into-the-mesh.svg)\n\n### Differences Between L4 and L7 Traffic\n\n| Traffic Type | Processing Location             | Example Scenarios                                            |\n| ------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **L4**       | ztunnel (transparent forwarding) | TCP-level traffic that does not require application-layer policies |\n| **L7**       | ztunnel → Waypoint Proxy         | HTTP\/gRPC traffic requiring advanced features like auth, routing, observability, etc. |\n\nFor most traffic that only needs encryption and forwarding at the TCP layer, Ambient Mode relies solely on \u0060ztunnel\u0060. Only when HTTP-layer policies are required does the traffic get routed through the Waypoint proxy.\n\n## Ambient Mode vs. Sidecar Mode\n\nNow that we understand Ambient Mode, it\u0027s important to compare it with the traditional Sidecar model to evaluate which scenarios best fit each and what gaps remain.\n\n### Limitations of Ambient Mode\n\nCompared to the traditional Sidecar model, Ambient Mode still has some limitations:\n\n- When **mixing** Ambient and Sidecar modes, it’s difficult to apply fine-grained proxy configurations (e.g., \u0060EnvoyFilter\u0060) to individual Pods.\n- Support for **multi-cluster**, **multi-network**, and **VM** workloads is not yet mature and requires caution in production environments.\n- Some advanced customizations, such as **WASM plugins**, cannot be applied directly on a per-Pod basis in Ambient Mode.\n\n### Feature and Behavior Comparison\n\n| Criteria            | **Sidecar Mode**                                                   | **Ambient Mode**                                                  |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Proxy Location**  | Each Pod runs its own Envoy sidecar                                | Node-level **ztunnel** \u002b optional **Waypoint Proxy**              |\n| **Resource Overhead** | Higher CPU\/memory usage, especially in large-scale environments     | Lower overhead; proxies are shared at the node\/namespace level    |\n| **Operational Complexity** | Sidecar upgrades require rolling restarts of all affected Pods     | Upgrades are centralized to a few components (ztunnel\/Waypoint)   |\n| **Performance**     | Strong per-Pod isolation but added proxy cost per Pod              | Better L4 performance; L7 adds one more forwarding hop via Waypoint |\n| **Feature Completeness** | Mature and stable; supports multi-cluster, VMs, and hybrid networks  | Still evolving; multi-network, and VM support are under development |\n| **Typical Scenarios** | Scenarios requiring strict isolation or custom \u0060EnvoyFilter\u0060\/WASM   | Large-scale clusters, lightweight management, mostly L4 traffic   |\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. If you\u0027re already using the **Sidecar** model and rely heavily on mature features, you can continue with Sidecar for now.\n2. If your priority is **resource savings** and **operational simplicity**, and most of your traffic is L4, try **Ambient Mode**.\n3. For hybrid needs, consider **mixed deployment**, but make sure to plan clearly around boundaries and policies for Sidecar vs. Ambient workloads.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLet’s wrap up with a summary of Ambient Mode’s pros, cons, and where it fits best.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Ambient Mode** reduces per-Pod proxy overhead by removing the Sidecar, significantly lowering resource and operational costs.\n2. **ztunnel \u002b Waypoint architecture**: L7 functionality is only activated when necessary; all other traffic is forwarded efficiently at L4.\n3. Although Ambient Mode has reached **GA**, features like **multi-cluster \/ VM \/ multi-network** support still need further testing and validation.\n4. Recommended for: **large-scale clusters**, **primarily L4 traffic**, and teams with high demands on resource efficiency and centralized management.\n\nYou can find more cloud-native articles and practical insights on my blog at [jimmysong.io](https:\/\/jimmysong.io).

It details the combination of EJBCA and cert-manager, including setup steps and emphasizes the importance of PKI best practices for secure and compliant service mesh.', '\nAuthors: Cristofer TenEyck Senior Solution Engineer a Keyfactor and Jimmy Song Developer Advocate at Tetrate\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn the evolving landscape of cloud-native applications, securing service meshes across multiple clusters is crucial for ensuring both security and compliance. Istio, a leading open-source service mesh, provides tools for securing communication between microservices. However, implementing a robust and scalable Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to manage certificates within this environment remains a significant challenge. \n\nIn this blog, we will delve into the implementation of a PKI solution using the EJBCA open-source PKI for an Istio service mesh spanning multiple clusters. We will focus on the process of setting up EJBCA, configuring the cert-manager EJBCA external issuer, and ensuring automatic certificate renewal for your Istio workloads. This guide will help you build a trusted and scalable PKI, enabling secure, compliant, and resilient service meshes. \n\nWhy multi-clusters? Multi-cluster deployments are becoming increasingly popular as organizations expand their Kubernetes infrastructure. Multi-cluster Istio setups provide enhanced availability, fault tolerance, and isolation of workloads across clusters. \n\n## Understanding PKI and its Role in Service Meshes \n\nPKI is a cornerstone of modern digital security. It involves managing keys and certificates to ensure secure communication between entities, be they users, applications, or services. In the context of a service mesh like Istio, an effective PKI is essential for securing communications between microservices, especially in multi-cluster environments. \n\nThe EJBCA offers an open-source solution for managing PKI at scale. Compared to other options like OpenSSL or Istio’s built-in PKI, EJBCA provides a full-featured, enterprise-grade PKI that is well-suited for simple to more complex and multi-purpose deployments. EJBCA’s capabilities go beyond just issuing mTLS certificates, offering compliance features, secure scalability, crypto agility, and integration with a wide range of applications. \n\n## Istio, EJBCA and cert-manager \n\nSetting up a PKI for a multi-cluster Istio environment using EJBCA. Here is what is included: \n\n1. **Environment Preparation**: We use a MicroK8s multi-cluster Istio setup, consisting of a primary and a remote cluster. Both clusters are configured to work with EJBCA as the root Certificate Authority (CA). \n2. **cert-manager Integration**: We showcase the integration of cert-manager with EJBCA, including the configuration of the EJBCA custom issuer. cert-manager will handle the issuance and renewal of certificates. \n3. **Automatic Certificate Renewal**: A key challenge in PKI management is ensuring that certificates are renewed automatically before they expire. cert-manager, with EJBCA, can achieve seamless, application-transparent certificate renewal across all clusters. \n\n![Architecture](arch.webp)\n\n## Architecture Setup with Istio using EJBCA as an External CA, a High-Level Summary \n\nThis section outlines the steps to set up Istio on Kubernetes clusters using EJBCA as an external Certificate Authority (CA). The setup involves configuring two MicroK8s clusters with MetalLB for load balancing, integrating EJBCA for certificate management, and installing Istio components using Helm. the complete guide can be found [here](https:\/\/docs.keyfactor.com\/ejbca\/latest\/tutorial-deploy-istio-service-mesh-in-a-multi).\n\nThe key steps include: \n\n1. **Install and Configure Helm Repositories**: Add necessary Helm repositories for Istio, cert-manager, and EJBCA. \n2. **Deploy cert-manager and EJBCA**: Install cert-manager using Helm in the primary and remote clusters, followed by the deployment of the EJBCA with a custom issuer. This step also includes generating and storing necessary certificates as Kubernetes secrets. \n3. **Configure Istio with EJBCA**: Create a custom Issuer in Kubernetes that points to the EJBCA instance for issuing certificates. This issuer is then integrated into the Istio configuration. \n4. **Install Istio Components**: Deploy the cert-manager-istio-csr to handle Istio’s certificate signing requests, followed by the installation of Istio’s base components, Istio CNI (Container Network Interface), Istiod (Istio control plane), and the Istio ingress gateway. \n5. **Customization and Overrides**: Apply custom values to tailor Istio’s behavior, such as specific cluster IDs, trust domains, and DNS configurations for secure communication between services. \n6. **Automatic Certificate Renewal:** The setup is configured so that cert-manager automatically renews certificates before they expire, with no disruption to the running applications. \n\n![Certificate renew flow](cert-renew-flow.webp)\n\nAbove is the flow diagram representing the mTLS certificate issuance and renewal process in Istio. It illustrates the flow from the Istiod control plane pushing the Envoy config to the final certificate issuance by EJBCA. \n\n## PKI Best Practices and Compliance \n\nBuilding a secure PKI for your Istio service mesh involves more than just setting up any PKI and starting issuing certificates. It requires adherence to best practices and compliance with regulations to stay secure and future-proof. Here are some key points to consider: \n\n1. **Compliance with Regulations**: Ensure your PKI implementation meets regulatory requirements such as the EU Cyber Resilience Act and the US Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity. This includes implementing a resilient architecture, maintaining audit trails, and ensuring robust key management practices. \n2. **Crypto Agility and Quantum Readiness**: As cryptographic standards evolve, your PKI must be agile enough to adapt to new algorithms and key lengths. With the potential advent of quantum computing, being quantum-ready is increasingly important. \n3. **Collaboration with InfoSec**: Effective collaboration with your Information Security (InfoSec) team is crucial for maintaining the security and compliance of your PKI. This includes regular reviews of security policies, ongoing training, and ensuring that PKI management processes align with organizational security goals. \n\n## Conclusion \n\nImplementing a PKI for an Istio service mesh in a multi-cluster environment can seem daunting, but with the right tools and practices, it can be achieved efficiently and effectively. EJBCA, combined with cert-manager, offers a solution for managing certificates at scale, ensuring that your Istio service mesh PKI is both secure and compliant. \n\nBy following the steps outlined in this guide, you will be able to set up a trusted PKI, achieve seamless and robust certificate management, and collaborate effectively with your InfoSec team to maintain the security of your service mesh. \n\nFor further resources and more detailed information on the topics covered in this blog, be sure to check out the links and references provided below. \n\n## Resources \n\n- [Tutorial – Deploy Istio Service Mesh in a Multi-Cluster Kubernetes Environment Using EJBCA as an External PKI provider](https:\/\/docs.keyfactor.com\/ejbca\/latest\/tutorial-deploy-istio-service-mesh-in-a-multi)\n- [Istio documentation](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/)\n- [EJBCA Community edition](https:\/\/www.ejbca.org\/)\n- [cert-manager documentation](https:\/\/cert-manager.io\/docs\/)\n- [EU Cyber Resilience Act](https:\/\/digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu\/en\/policies\/cyber-resilience-act)\n- [US Executive Order on Cybersecurity](https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefing-room\/statements-releases\/2021\/05\/12\/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity\/)\n- [A Definitive Guide to Cross-Cluster Seamless Access in Multicluster Istio Service Mesh](\/en\/blog\/seamless-cross-cluster-access-istio\/)\n\n---\n\n*This blog was initially published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/multi-cluster-pki-istio-recipe-practical-example-for-a-trusted-and-scalable-pki-for-your-service-mesh\/).*\n', '\/en\/blog\/multi-cluster-pki-istio-recipe\/')">

It revolutionizes the traditional Sidecar architecture, reduces resource consumption, and is suitable for modern cloud-native applications.', '\nIn the world of microservices and cloud-native applications, service meshes have become essential for managing service-to-service communication. However, traditional sidecar-based architectures introduce significant latency and resource overhead, posing challenges for latency-sensitive and large-scale applications. **Kmesh** emerges as a groundbreaking solution—a high-performance, kernel-native service mesh data plane that leverages eBPF and kernel enhancements to deliver unparalleled efficiency and performance.\n\n## Background\n\nService meshes like Istio have become integral in managing complex microservices architectures, providing features like traffic management, security, and observability. The sidecar model, where a proxy runs alongside each service instance, has been the predominant approach. While effective in functionality, this architecture introduces significant latency and resource overhead.\n\n{{\u003ccallout note \u0022Note\u0022\u003e}}\n\nAll data presented in this article is quoted from [A New Choice for Istio Data Plane: Architectural Innovation for a Brand-New Performance Experience](https:\/\/kccncossaidevchn2024.sched.com\/event\/1eYWy\/a-new-choice-for-istio-data-plane-architectural-innovation-for-a-brand-new-performance-experience-istioxiao-zha-sao-daepxia-mo-zha-zhonghu-xu-huawei?iframe=no). I have not verified the accuracy of these data. You are requested to judge and verify the reliability of these data on your own.\n\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\n## Limitations of Traditional Sidecar Architectures\n\n1. **Latency Overhead**: The addition of sidecar proxies results in increased network hops and context switches, introducing an extra **2 to 3 milliseconds** of latency per service call. For latency-sensitive applications, this delay is unacceptable.\n\n2. **Resource Consumption**: Each sidecar consumes CPU and memory resources. In large-scale deployments with thousands of services, the accumulated resource overhead is huge. Although it can be optimized through certain technical means, it still reduces deployment density and increases operating costs.\n\nPerformance measurements of Istio reveal that even without traffic distribution, there\u0027s an inherent latency overhead of approximately 3 milliseconds. As the number of connections grows, latency increases correspondingly, highlighting the inefficiency of the sidecar model for high-performance applications.\n\n## Industry Attempts to Address the Challenges\n\nSeveral solutions have been proposed to mitigate the drawbacks of sidecar architectures:\n\n### Cilium Service Mesh\n\n- **Approach**: Combines eBPF with Envoy to create a sidecar-less service mesh.\n- **Mechanism**:\n  - **L4 Traffic**: Uses eBPF for efficient kernel-level data routing.\n  - **L7 Traffic**: Relies on Envoy for application-layer parsing.\n- **Limitations**:\n  - **Extra Hops for L7**: L7 governance through Envoy introduces additional network hops.\n  - **Fault Isolation**: Challenges in ensuring governance fault isolation.\n\n### Istio Ambient Mesh\n\n- **Approach**: Introduces sidecar-less architecture using **ztunnel** and **waypoint** proxies.\n- **Mechanism**:\n  - **User-Space Processing**: All traffic interception and management occur in user space.\n- **Limitations**:\n  - **Complex Traffic Interception**: User-space interception increases complexity.\n  - **Increased Hops**: L7 connections involve multiple network hops, adding latency.\n\nThese solutions, while innovative, do not fully resolve the latency and resource overhead issues inherent in sidecar architectures.\n\n## Introducing Kmesh: A Kernel-Native Approach\n\nKmesh defines a new service mesh data plane by directly integrating traffic governance into the operating system kernel. Utilizing eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) and kernel enhancements, Kmesh provides high-performance, low-latency, and resource-efficient service mesh capabilities.\n\n### Technical Architecture\n\n![Kmesh Architecture](kmesh-arch.svg)\n\n**Core Components**:\n\n- **Kmesh-Daemon**: A per-node management component responsible for:\n  - Managing eBPF programs.\n  - Subscribing to xDS configurations from the control plane (e.g., Istiod).\n  - Handling observability and metrics collection.\n\n- **eBPF Orchestration**: Implements traffic interception and management at the kernel level, supporting:\n  - L4 load balancing.\n  - Traffic encryption and decryption.\n  - Monitoring and simple L7 dynamic routing.\n\n- **Waypoint Proxy (Optional in Dual Engine Mode)**: Handles advanced L7 traffic governance, deployed per namespace or per service as needed.\n\n### Key Advantages\n\n![Kmesh vs Sidecar vs Ambient ([Source](https:\/\/kccncossaidevchn2024.sched.com\/event\/1eYWy\/a-new-choice-for-istio-data-plane-architectural-innovation-for-a-brand-new-performance-experience-istioxiao-zha-sao-daepxia-mo-zha-zhonghu-xu-huawei?iframe=no))](performance.webp)\n\n1. **High Performance**:\n   - **Latency Reduction**: Kernel-native L7 management reduces forwarding latency by over **60%** compared to traditional sidecar architectures.\n   - **Improved Application Startup**: Application bootstrap times improve by **40%** due to the elimination of sidecar initialization.\n\n2. **Low Resource Overhead**:\n   - **Resource Efficiency**: Eliminates the need for sidecar proxies, reducing resource consumption by over **70%**.\n\n3. **High Availability**:\n   - **Seamless Upgrades**: Kernel-level traffic management ensures that upgrading or restarting Kmesh components does not disrupt existing service connections.\n\n4. **Security Isolation**:\n   - **Enhanced Security**: Utilizes BPF-based virtual machine security and cgroup-level governance isolation to ensure secure multi-tenancy.\n\n5. **Flexible Governance Model**:\n   - **Deployment Modes**: Offers both Kernel-Native Mode for maximum performance and Dual Engine Mode for deployment flexibility.\n\n6. **Seamless Compatibility**:\n   - **Control Plane Integration**: Fully compatible with the xDS protocol, allowing integration with Istio\u0027s control plane and supporting Istio APIs and Gateway APIs.\n\n## Two Operational Modes of Kmesh\n\nKmesh provides two operational modes to cater to different deployment needs:\n\n### Kernel-Native Mode\n\n**Overview**:\n\n- **Ultimate Performance**: Achieves the lowest possible latency with no additional network hops for both L4 and L7 traffic.\n- **Mechanism**:\n  - **Kernel Enhancements**: Enhances the kernel using eBPF and kernel modules (ko).\n  - **Fake TCP Connections**: Utilizes forged connections to manage complex application-layer traffic within the kernel.\n  - **Traffic Management**: Directly manages traffic as soon as the client initiates communication, eliminating unnecessary context switches and data copies.\n\n**Benefits**:\n\n- **Latency Reduction**: Reduces forwarding latency by over 60%.\n- **No Dependency on User-Space Proxies**: Entire traffic management is handled within the kernel.\n\n**Considerations**:\n\n- **Kernel Version Requirements**: May require specific kernel versions or enhancements, which could impact deployment flexibility.\n\n### Dual Engine Mode\n\n**Overview**:\n\n- **Flexible Governance**: Balances performance with broader compatibility and flexibility.\n- **Mechanism**:\n  - **Kernel-Level Interception**: Uses eBPF to intercept traffic in the kernel space.\n  - **Waypoint Proxy**: Deploys a remote waypoint proxy to handle complex L7 traffic management.\n  - **Layer Separation**: Splits L4 and L7 governance between kernel space (eBPF) and user space (waypoint).\n\n**Benefits**:\n\n- **Latency Reduction**: Reduces latency by **30%** compared to Istio\u0027s Ambient Mesh.\n- **Simplified Traffic Interception**: Kernel-space interception is more secure and simpler than user-space interception.\n- **Lower Adoption Threshold**: Reduced dependency on specific kernel versions, making it easier for users to adopt.\n\n**Comparison with Ambient Mesh**:\n\n- **Fewer Network Hops**: Kmesh adds only one extra hop for L7 connections, whereas Ambient Mesh may add up to three.\n- **Simpler Architecture**: Kernel-level interception avoids the complexity of user-space interception mechanisms.\n\n## Deep Dive into Kmesh\u0027s Technology\n\n### eBPF and Kernel Enhancements\n\n**eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter)** is a powerful technology that allows the injection of custom code into the Linux kernel safely and efficiently. Kmesh leverages eBPF to:\n\n- **Intercept Network Traffic**: Attach eBPF programs to network events, enabling real-time interception and manipulation of packets.\n- **Implement Load Balancing**: Direct traffic to appropriate service instances based on policies.\n- **Perform Traffic Encryption**: Handle mTLS encryption and decryption within the kernel, reducing overhead.\n- **Collect Observability Data**: Gather metrics and telemetry data without impacting application performance.\n\n### Traffic Interception and Management\n\nIn the Kernel-Native Mode:\n\n- **Forged Connections**: Kmesh creates fake TCP connections within the kernel to manage traffic without involving user-space proxies.\n- **Direct Packet Manipulation**: Packets are intercepted and redirected at the kernel level, eliminating context switches and data copies that occur when moving packets between user space and kernel space.\n\nIn the Dual Engine Mode:\n\n- **eBPF Interception**: eBPF programs handle initial traffic interception and basic L4 management.\n- **Waypoint Proxy**: For advanced L7 features like routing, retries, and header manipulation, traffic is forwarded to a waypoint proxy deployed per service or namespace.\n\n### Security and Isolation\n\n- **BPF Virtual Machine Security**: eBPF runs in a restricted virtual machine within the kernel, ensuring that injected code cannot compromise kernel stability.\n- **Cgroup-Level Isolation**: Governance policies are applied at the cgroup level, providing isolation between different services and workloads.\n- **mTLS Support**: Mutual TLS is implemented within the kernel (Under development.

Taking Istio as an example, it enables users to programmatically manage traffic aware of applications, ensure robust observability, and maintain solid security within the network. Istio ensures resilience in cloud-native and distributed systems, enabling modern enterprises to maintain their workloads across various platforms while ensuring connectivity and protection. Its capabilities include zero-trust security, policy management, access control for security and governance, as well as canary deployments, A\/B testing, load balancing, and fault recovery for network functions. It also provides observability across all network traffic. Istio is unrestricted by any single cluster, network, or runtime and can incorporate services running on Kubernetes or virtual machines within a single mesh, whether across multi-cloud, hybrid, or on-premises environments. Its design is scalable and supported by an extensive ecosystem.\n\nThe architecture of a service mesh is divided into the control plane and the data plane. In the case of Istio, \u0060istiod\u0060 acts as the control plane, while the data plane offers two deployment modes: sidecar or ambient.\n\n![Architecture of the Istio Service Mesh (Source: [istio.io](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/about\/service-mesh\/))](service-mesh.svg)\n\nIn fact, there are more than these two modes for deploying the service mesh data plane. Including Istio\u0027s [proxyless gRPC service mesh](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2021\/proxyless-grpc\/) and the [Cilium service mesh](https:\/\/cilium.io\/use-cases\/service-mesh\/), there are a total of four deployment modes.\n\n## Data Plane Deployment Modes\n\nThe following table compares the service mesh data plane deployment modes across several dimensions.\n\n{{\u003ctable \u0022Comparison of Four Service Mesh Deployment Modes\u0022\u003e}}\n\n| **Data plane modes**                                   | **Platform security** Threat assessment, risk                | **Resource Efficiency** – infra\/resource consumption, etc.   | **Manageability** – upgrades, vulnerabilities, etc.          | **Performance** – Latency, etc.                              |\n| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **Sidecar mode:** L4 and L7 Proxy per Service Instance | High security, as each service instance has an independent proxy, reducing the attack surface. Risk management depends on control plane configuration. | Higher resource consumption, as each instance requires an independent proxy. | Centralized management and configuration required, upgrades are relatively complex, but can be simplified through the control plane. | May increase latency as requests need to be forwarded through the proxy. |\n| **Ambient mode:** Shared L4 – L7 per Service Model     | Designed for security with ztunnel for local routing. However, shared proxies can introduce risks, and its overall security maturity is still evolving. | Higher efficiency as multiple services share the same proxy. | Relatively simple management, but may face vulnerabilities due to the shared proxy. | Good performance with local routing, but may incur cross-AZ costs with waypoint proxies. |\n| **Cilium mesh mode:** Shared L4 and L7 Model           | Moderate security with a focus on eBPF and fine-grained access control. However, there are known issues with identity and trust models. | Efficiency due to kernel-level processing, reducing infrastructure expenses. | Management is more complex, needing to handle configurations for multiple services. | Variable performance; certain scenarios might introduce significant latency. |\n| **gRPC mode:** L4 and L7 Part of the Application Model | While gRPC integrates proxy functions within the application, theoretically reducing the attack surface, the application\u0027s complexity and variability can actually expand it. The security of the gRPC mode depends on specific use cases and needs careful evaluation of potential threats and attack surfaces. | Higher efficiency because the proxy is implemented inline in the same process as the app. | Complex management, regular updates and maintenance of application layer proxy required. | Superior performance with low latency, suitable for real-time applications. |\n\n{{\u003c\/table\u003e}}\n\nYou can see a more visual comparison of these four modes in terms of cost and security from the diagram below:\n\n![Comparison of Service Mesh Deployment Modes](istio-data-plane-deployment-modes.svg)\n\nThese four deployment modes are differentiated based on how proxies are associated with service instances.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates potential locations for proxies in different deployment modes of the service mesh data plane.\n\n![Potential Locations of Proxies in the Data Plane](overview.svg)\n\n- **Sidecar Mode**: The proxy is in the same Pod as the application container.\n- **Ambient Mode**: The L4 proxy is on the same node as the application container, while the L7 proxy may not be on the same node.\n- **Cilium Mode**: The L4 and L7 proxies are combined and located on the same node as the application container.\n- **gRPC Mode**: The gRPC framework is integrated into the application and deployed within the same container.\n\n## Sidecar Mode: L4 and L7 Proxy per Service Instance\n\nThe diagram below shows the communication paths in sidecar mode where Application 1 accesses Application 2 on the same node and Application 3 across nodes.\n\n![Sidecar Mode: L4 and L7 Proxy per Service Instance](sidecar-mode.svg)\n\nThis is the most common deployment mode for service meshes and was the initial mode supported by [Istio](https:\/\/istio.io\/). Each service instance is accompanied by a proxy (such as [Envoy](https:\/\/envoyproxy.io\/)), which handles all inbound and outbound network communications, including L4 and L7 layers.\n\n- **Advantages**: High security, as each service instance is isolated, reducing potential attack surfaces.\n- **Disadvantages**: High resource consumption, as each service instance requires a separate proxy, increasing infrastructure costs.\n- **Maturity**: The maturity of the Istio Sidecar mode has reached the production level. They have undergone extensive testing and are ready for use in actual environments. \n\n## Ambient Mode: Shared L4 – L7 per Service Model\n\nThe diagram below illustrates the communication paths in ambient mode where Application 1 accesses Application 2 on the same node and Application 3 across nodes.\n\n![Ambient Mode: Node-shared L4 Proxy, Service Account-shared L7 Proxy](ambient-mode.svg)\n\nIn this mode, a shared L4 proxy on each node serves all service instances on the same physical host, while each service account has a dedicated L7 proxy.\n\n- **Advantages:** Lower costs, as the proxy is shared among multiple services.\n- **Disadvantages:** Although the ztunnel component is designed for security, shared proxies can introduce risks. The security maturity of this model is still evolving.\n- **Maturity**: The Istio ambient mode is currently in the beta stage; there are no large-scale production-level best practices yet, and it does not support multi-clusters.\n\n## Cilium Mesh Mode: Shared L4 and L7 Model\n\nThe diagram below displays the communication paths in Cilium mesh mode where Application 1 accesses Application 2 on the same node and Application 3 across nodes.\n\n![Cilium Mesh Mode: Shared L4 and L7 Proxies](cilium-mesh-mode.svg)\n\nThis mode is a middle ground between fully independent and fully shared setups, with each node having a shared L7 proxy. However, there are known issues with identities and trust models. The Cilium service mesh, which uses eBPF, allows for network policies without a proxy through kernel programs.\n\n- **Advantages**: Kernel-level efficiency can reduce infrastructure costs in specific scenarios.\n- **Disadvantages**: Management is more complex, and certain scenarios may result in increased latency.\n- **Maturity**: Cilium mesh manages L4 traffic directly through eBPF and configures the Envoy proxy on each node to control L7 traffic via CRDs (such as CiliumEnvoyConfig). However, there are concerns about its security due to inconsistent identity models.\n\n\u003e **Note**: *This model is not the data plane of Istio.*\n\n## gRPC Mode: L4 and L7 Part of the Application Model\n\nIn the gRPC mode, no external proxies are deployed; instead, proxy functions are directly integrated into the application using the RPC framework, leading to significant intrusion into the application. The service mesh control plane uses a set of discovery APIs known as xDS APIs to dynamically configure the application. The gRPC client libraries within the application provide extensive support for the xDS APIs. With this capability, the service mesh control plane can program L4 and L7 proxy functions directly within this library inside the service container.\n\nThe diagram below illustrates how, in Istio’s gRPC mode, the control plane communicates with the application.\n\n![gRPC Mode: L4 and L7 Proxies Integrated into the Application](grpc-mode.svg)\n\nIn this mode, when a gRPC service communicates with the control plane, a traditional Sidecar proxy is not needed; instead, a specific agent is used for initialization and communication with the control plane. This design reduces resource consumption and deployment complexity while still enabling functions such as service discovery and traffic management.\n\n- **Advantages**: High performance, as the proxy is tightly integrated with the application, reducing network hops and additional overhead.\n- **Disadvantages**: High complexity, as complex network processing functions need to be implemented within the application, which may increase development costs.\n- **Security Considerations**: The security of this model is debated. While integrating proxy functions within the application theoretically reduces the external attack surface, the application\u0027s diversity and complexity could expand the overall attack surface. Therefore, when considering the security of the gRPC mode, it is crucial to carefully analyze the security threat model and attack risks in specific use cases.\n- **Maturity**: The gRPC mode in Istio is still in the experimental stage.\n\n## Which Mode Should I Use?\n\nAs previously introduced, several factors influence the choice of a service mesh data plane deployment mode:\n\n- Maturity\n- Enterprise security needs\n- Resource constraints\n- Performance requirements\n- Network overhead\n- Tolerance for management complexity\n\n### Maturity\n\nWhen considering the deployment modes of the service mesh data plane, maturity is a key factor. The maturity level of each mode affects its reliability and support in production environments:\n\n- **Sidecar Mode**: This is the most mature service mesh deployment mode, widely adopted in production environments and well-supported.\n- **Ambient Mode**: While this mode offers some cost and performance advantages, it is still in the early stages and may lack mature best practices and broad ecosystem support.\n- **Cilium Mesh Mode**: As a relatively new option, it offers unique technological advantages, especially in scenarios using eBPF. However, concerns about its security model and identity management suggest it may not be as mature or reliable as other modes.\n- **gRPC Mode**: Despite excellent performance, the complexity and intrusiveness of this mode mean it may require more custom development and is still in the experimental stage.\n\n### Enterprise Security Needs\n\nIf your business has high security requirements, such as in the financial or healthcare sectors, then the **Sidecar Mode** might be the best choice. This mode provides strong security by ensuring each service instance has its own independent proxy, thus maximizing service isolation. For those exploring newer models like **Ambient Mode**, it\u0027s essential to understand that while ztunnel aims for secure local routing, the model\u0027s overall security strategy is still evolving.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n\nIn resource-constrained environments, deploying a separate proxy for each service instance may not be practical. In such cases, consider the **gRPC Mode** or **Ambient Mode**. **gRPC Mode** is particularly suitable for organizations that already use gRPC extensively and are willing to handle complex networking functions internally within the application. The **Ambient Mode**, on the other hand, uses a shared proxy to reduce resource consumption.\n\n### Performance Requirements\n\nFor applications requiring high performance and low latency, the **gRPC Mode** provides optimal performance because it eliminates the additional network hops introduced by traditional proxies. However, it\u0027s important to note that the gRPC Mode is still experimental and may not support all features of Istio. Consider your service mesh functionality needs accordingly.\n\n### Network Overhead\n\nEach data plane mode has distinct characteristics affecting network overhead. **Sidecar mode**, with locality-aware routing, reduces cross-zone traffic but adds network hops, increasing latency and compute use. **Ambient mode** uses ztunnels for local routing but may incur cross-AZ costs with waypoint proxies. **Cilium mode** places proxies on the same node as applications, potentially reducing inter-node traffic but could introduce more latency. **gRPC mode** integrates RPC framework into the application, minimizing network hops and overhead, ideal for high-performance, low-latency needs.\n\n### Tolerance for Management Complexity\n\nManagement complexity is also a significant consideration when choosing a service mesh data plane mode. **Sidecar Mode** and **gRPC Mode** may require more complex configurations and maintenance, while the **Ambient Mode** might offer a more streamlined management experience in some deployment environments. **Cilium Mode** could require complex management due to its reliance on eBPF and multiple configuration points.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nChoosing the right service mesh data plane deployment mode depends on specific factors including maturity, security, resource constraints, performance, and management complexity. Here’s a quick guide:\n\n- **Sidecar Mode**: Best for high security needs, offering the most isolation.\n- **gRPC Mode**: Suitable for environments with high-performance demands where gRPC is already in use.\n- **Ambient Mode**: Good for cost-effectiveness and lower isolation needs, but the security model is evolving.\n- **Cilium Mesh Mode**: Could be good for infrastructures utilizing eBPF technology, but consider security and management complexity.\n\nThe best choice will align with your application requirements, security policies, and technical familiarity. It’s essential to understand each mode’s strengths and limitations to make an informed decision that balances benefits, risks, and costs.\n\n## References\n\n- [Service Mesh Proxy Models for Cloud-Native Applications](https:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/pubs\/sp\/800\/233\/ipd)\n\n---\n\n*This blog was initially published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/ambient-vs-sidecar\/).*\n', '\/en\/blog\/service-mesh-data-plane-deployment-modes\/')">

As a participant and a panel moderator, I will share in this article the highlights of the conference and the in-depth discussions on service meshes and gateway technologies.\n\n![KubeCon China Scene](https:\/\/jimmysong.io\/img\/blog\/kubecon-china-2024-recap\/kubecon-china-2024-hall.webp)\n\n## Key Themes\n\nThis edition of KubeCon introduced a theme on AI and developers, here are some of the focal points:\n\n1. **Practical Applications of Cloud Native Technologies in Industries**: Especially in the electric vehicle and cybersecurity sectors, such as the joint discussion by Huawei and NIO on how cloud native technologies can accelerate innovation in electric vehicles.\n\n2. **The Power of the Kubernetes Community**: Detailed discussions on the influence of China\u0027s Kubernetes community and its role in advancing regional cloud native activities.\n\n3. **The Integration of Open Source Technology and Artificial Intelligence**: Discussions on the advanced position of China and Hong Kong in the fields of open source and AI technologies and how these are driving regional technological innovation and development.\n\n4. **Latest Developments in Service Meshes and API Gateways**: Including updates on service mesh technologies and how they work in conjunction with Kubernetes schedulers to enhance system throughput.\n\n5. **New Strategies for Supply Chain Security**: Focusing on the latest developments in securing supply chains, particularly practical guidelines on SLSA compliance.\n\n6. **Multicluster Management and Edge Computing**: Discussions on strategies for effective management and innovation across different architectures and systems.\n\n7. **Optimization of AI Large Model Inference Performance**: Discussion on performance acceleration in serverless architectures for AI large model inference and related technological advancements.\n\n## Istio and Modern API Gateways: Exploring the Future of Service Meshes\n\nIn a [roundtable discussion](https:\/\/kccncossaidevchn2024.sched.com\/event\/1eYY6\/istio-and-modern-api-gateways-navigating-the-future-of-service-meshes-istiorejiong-apijie-daepqiu-jie-zha-jimmy-song-jianpeng-he-tetrate-jiaqi-zhang-alibaba-cloud-jintao-zhang-kong-inc-xunzhuo-liu-tencent) that I participated in with industry leaders from Tetrate, Alibaba Cloud, and Kong Inc., we delved deeply into the latest developments and integrations of Istio and API gateways.\n\n![KubeCon China 2024 Istio and Modern API Gateways Panel](https:\/\/jimmysong.io\/img\/blog\/kubecon-china-2024-recap\/kubecon-china-2024-panel.webp)\n\n1. **Innovations in Istio**: We discussed the latest version update of Istio (Istio 1.123) and key features such as optimizations in the Ambient mode, a new architectural choice that reduces resource consumption while enhancing performance.\n\n2. **Practical Comparison Between Ambient and Sidecar Modes**:\n   - **When to Choose Sidecar**: When high isolation and detailed traffic management are required.\n   - **When to Choose Ambient**: When pursuing ultimate performance and resource efficiency.\n\n3. **Challenges in the Development of Ambient Mode**: Despite its advantages, Ambient mode still faces challenges in complex traffic management and multi-tenant environments.\n\n4. **Service Mesh Optimization Strategies**: Discussing methods to enhance the performance and efficiency of cloud applications through service mesh improvements.\n\n5. **Integration of Service Meshes and API Gateways**: Demonstrating how these two technologies work together to support more complex deployment and operational modes.\n\n## Future Perspectives on Istio\n\nIn the [presentation by Zhonghu Xu and Jianpeng He](https:\/\/kccncossaidevchn2024.sched.com\/event\/1eYcG\/what-is-the-future-of-service-mesh-sidecar-or-sidecarless-jie-zha-dyagsyi-wu-pi-yi-wu-zhonghu-xu-huawei), we gained insights into the possible future directions of Istio:\n\n- **Dual Mode Drive**: Istio is likely to support both the Ambient mode and the traditional Sidecar mode simultaneously. Ambient mode suits users seeking performance and cost optimization, while the Sidecar mode will continue to support users requiring comprehensive functionalities.\n\n- **Support for Gateway API**: Istio\u0027s support for the Gateway API provides users with more flexible routing and policy configuration options.\n\n- **Application of Waypoints Strategies**: Waypoints need not be limited to Istio or Envoy. Using the Gateway API and GAMMA, any standard-compliant implementation can serve as a Waypoint, offering greater flexibility and scalability for service meshes.\n\n### Sandwich Waypoint\n\nThey emphasized the Sandwich Waypoint, which supports:\n\n- **Traffic Redirection**: By setting the \u0060istio.io\/use-waypoint: {namespace}\/{gateway-name}\u0060 annotation, traffic to a target service, pod, or within a namespace can be redirected to the same Waypoint.\n- **Waypoint Deployment**: Users can deploy a Waypoint by creating a Gateway object. Unlike the original implementation of Waypoint, the new deployment method will include associated services and service accounts, not just the Waypoint instance.\n- **Routing and Policy Configuration**: Using the Gateway API for routing and policy configuration provides more customization options for users and providers.\n\nThis represents a mode in Istio\u0027s Ambient mode for capturing layer 7 traffic, as illustrated below.\n\n![Sandwich Waypoint Traffic Capture](istio-ambient-traffic-capture.svg)\n\nThe steps for capturing layer 7 traffic with Istio Sandwich Waypoint are as follows:\n\n1. Terminate the HBONE connection via zTunnel, arriving at the Waypoint, with zTunnel responsible for decoding the HBONE protocol.\n2. Waypoint extracts destination addresses, source addresses, etc., to handle traffic and determine forwarding locations.\n3. Waypoint expands or parses the transport layer encapsulation (TLV) data, with proxies supporting TLV processing to provide additional context.\n4. Waypoint communicates with the peer zTunnel, coordinating with the server-side zTunnel to ensure correct traffic transfer.\n5. Encapsulate HBONE, sent by the server-side zTunnel to the final server destination, achieving fine-grained traffic management and routing in an Istio environment while maintaining compatibility with existing network protocols.\n\n## Cutting-Edge Extensions in Envoy Gateway\n\nIn a [presentation](https:\/\/kccncossaidevchn2024.sched.com\/event\/1eYcX\/gateway-api-and-beyond-introducing-envoy-gateways-gateway-api-extensions-jie-api-daeptao-envoyjie-zha-jie-api-huabing-zhao-tetrate) at KubeCon, Huabing Zhao discussed how Envoy Gateway enhances its capabilities and flexibility by extending the Kubernetes Gateway API, covering a wide range of matching and routing capabilities, new resource and policy models, and details of security policies.\n\n- **Gateway API Compatibility**: Envoy Gateway is fully compatible with the Gateway API and offers a wide range of matching and routing options. These include HTTP host and path matching, HTTP header-based operations, weighted load balancing, and support for gRPC, UDP, and TCP routing.\n- **Policies for Advanced Traffic Management:** The introduction of ClientTrafficPolicy and BackendTrafficPolicy provides users with more granular control over traffic management for both upstream and downstream connections, including features such as rate limiting, retries, load balancing, circuit breakers, and more.\n- **Enhancement of Security and Authentication**: The introduced SecurityPolicy supports CORS, HTTP basic authentication, OIDC, JWT authentication, and can integrate with various identity providers. It also provides detailed access control, allowing authorization based on the requester\u0027s original IP, JWT claims, etc.\n- **Expanding Functionality with Custom Extensions:** Envoy Gateway offers support for custom extensions through WASM (WebAssembly) and external process extensions. This allows users to enhance the gateway’s functionality by integrating their own customized extensions, tailored to specific use cases and operational needs.\n- **Future Exploration**: Future versions are expected to support non-Kubernetes environments deployment, optimize memory usage in the control plane, and expand authorization capabilities.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThrough this conference, we gained insights into Istio\u0027s Ambient mode and the developments in Envoy Gateway. The discussions on these technologies not only forecast future trends but also provided practical insights to facilitate the implementation and innovation of technologies.', '\/en\/blog\/kubecon-china-2024-recap\/')">

              <a href="#" onclick="exportToMarkdown('Deep Dive into Istio 1.22: New Features and Practical Application Advice', 'Explore the new features and practical advice of Istio 1.22, including the delta xDS, path template support, and API upgrades, to optimize service mesh management.', '\nThe recent [release of Istio 1.22](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/news\/releases\/1.22.x\/announcing-1.22\/) includes a plethora of significant updates. This article shares the new features and application recommendations brought by this release.\n\n## Ambient Mode Enters Beta Phase\n\nAlthough Ambient mode has now entered the Beta phase, this does not mean we can completely do away with Sidecars. While the Istio official claims that Ambient mode simplifies operations and significantly reduces memory and CPU usage, it still has limitations and potential complexity issues. For example, while Sidecars are eliminated, the introduction of new ztunnel and waypoint components may pose new challenges. For more detailed information about Ambient mode entering Beta, refer to the [Istio official blog](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2024\/ambient-reaches-beta\/).\n\n**Challenges Introduced by Ambient Mode**\n\n- Management of L7 traffic in Ambient mode is not yet mature\n- mTLS is forced to be enabled at the namespace level, meaning you cannot disable mTLS in Ambient mode\n- Zero-downtime upgrades in Ambient mode have not been resolved\n- Lack of best practices for coexistence and migration from Sidecar mode\n\nFor a comparison of Sidecar mode and Ambient mode, see [Analysis of Limitations in Istio Ambient Mode](\/blog\/istio-ambient-mode-limitations\/).\n\n{{\u003c callout note \u0022Recommendation\u0022\u003e}}\nIf you are just starting with Istio, especially if you only need to automatically enable mTLS for services, you can consider using Ambient mode at this stage. However, for L7 functionalities, it is recommended to wait until Ambient mode is fully mature before considering it for production use.\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\n## Istio API Upgrades\n\nIn the Istio 1.22 release, key APIs related to traffic management, security, and telemetry have officially been upgraded to the \u0060v1\u0060 version. You only need to change the API version of your existing configuration to \u0060v1\u0060, with no other changes needed. These APIs are already mature, and you can safely use the \u0060v1\u0060 version. For environments requiring high stability, Istio has added [validating admission policies](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/reference\/access-authn-authz\/validating-admission-policy\/) to ensure that only \u0060v1\u0060 APIs and fields can be used in the Istio API.\n\nFor example, the following AuthorizationPolicy example.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml {linenos=table,hl_lines=1}\napiVersion: security.istio.io\/v1beta1\nkind: AuthorizationPolicy\nmetadata:\n  name: finance-to-supply-chain\n  namespace: finance\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: finance-app\n  action: ALLOW\n  rules:\n  - from:\n    - source:\n        namespaces: [\u0022finance\u0022]\n    to:\n    - operation:\n        methods: [\u0022GET\u0022, \u0022POST\u0022]\n        paths: [\u0022\/api\/supply1\u0022, \u0022\/api\/supply2\u0022]\n    when:\n    - key: request.headers[:authority]\n      values: [\u0022supply-chain-service.supply-chain.svc.cluster.local\u0022]\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nOther extension-type APIs such as \u0060EnvoyFilter\u0060, \u0060WasmPlugin\u0060, \u0060ProxyConfig\u0060 are still in alpha or beta stages. For more information on API upgrades, please refer to the [v1 API blog](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2024\/v1-apis\/).\n\n{{\u003c callout note \u0022Recommendation\u0022\u003e}}\nFor commonly used functionalities, you can confidently use the \u0060v1\u0060 API. For extension-type APIs that are not yet stable, enabling validating admission policies is recommended to ensure system stability.\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\n## Gateway API Upgrade\n\n[Gateway API](\/blog\/why-gateway-api-is-the-future-of-ingress-and-mesh\/) has been updated to version 1.1.0 and is now widely available. This update extends Istio\u0027s traffic management capabilities, but it is important to be cautious of compatibility issues between Istio\u0027s native APIs and the Gateway API when migrating to the new API to avoid relying on features that are not fully mature yet. For more details, check out the [Gateway API v1.1 blog](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2024\/gateway-mesh-ga\/).\n\n{{\u003c callout note \u0022Recommendation\u0022\u003e}}\nFor existing deployments that are already stable using Istio API, continue using them, especially in scenarios requiring advanced features. For new deployments, consider using the stable version of the Gateway API to take advantage of its modern traffic management capabilities. Due to existing compatibility issues, do not rashly migrate to the Gateway API, as it may not be worth the risk.\n{{\u003c\/ callout\u003e}}\n\n## Delta xDS Enabled by Default\n\nIstio 1.22 version now has delta xDS enabled by default, which is a mechanism to optimize configuration distribution. Compared to the traditional State of the World (SotW) mode, delta xDS only sends changed configurations to the Envoy proxies, thereby significantly reducing the amount of data transmitted over the network and the resource consumption of the control plane. This change is particularly suitable for large-scale deployment environments with frequent configuration updates, improving the efficiency and performance of configuration updates. Additionally, delta xDS also helps manage configuration updates more efficiently in complex network environments or dynamically changing configurations.\n\n{{\u003c callout note \u0022Recommendation\u0022\u003e}}\nThe delta xDS has been developed several versions ago but was not enabled by default. Now that this feature is stable, you can use it with confidence.\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\nFor more on xDS, refer to the [Introduction to Envoy xDS and Configuration Distribution Process in Istio](\/blog\/istio-delta-xds-for-envoy\/).\n\n### Path Template Support with Wildcards for AuthorizationPolicy\n\nIn Istio 1.22, \u0060AuthorizationPolicy\u0060 has added support for [path templates](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/reference\/config\/security\/authorization-policy\/#Operation), greatly enhancing the flexibility and precision of path matching. Prior to this, \u0060AuthorizationPolicy\u0060 did not support wildcards in path configurations. This feature allows for defining paths in HTTP requests using URI templates based on Envoy, including simple wildcards (\u0060*\u0060 and \u0060**\u0060) or named variables, enabling precise matching of single or multiple path components. For example, the path template \u0060\/foo\/{*}\u0060 can match \u0060\/foo\/bar\u0060 but not \u0060\/foo\/bar\/baz\u0060, while \u0060\/foo\/{**}\/\u0060 can match any path starting with \u0060\/foo\/\u0060. This flexible path template design is particularly suitable for dynamic and complex routing rules, further strengthening Istio\u0027s security policy toolbox.\n\nThe diagram below illustrates the wildcard rules for path matching in AuthorizationPolicy.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060mermaid \u0022AuthorizationPolicy Path Matching Wildcard Rules\u0022\ngraph LR\n    A[AuthorizationPolicy Path Matching] --\u003e B(Define Path Templates)\n    B --\u003e C{Path Template Operators}\n    C --\u003e D[\u0022* (Match single segment)\u0022]\n    C --\u003e E[\u0022** (Match multiple segments)\u0022]\n    C --\u003e F[\u0022{name} (Named variable matching one segment)\u0022]\n    C --\u003e G[\u0022{name=**} (Named variable matching multiple segments)\u0022]\n\n    D --\u003e H[\u0022\/foo\/{*} matches \/foo\/bar\u0022]\n    E --\u003e I[\u0022\/foo\/{**}\/ matches \/foo\/bar\/, \/foo\/bar\/baz.txt\u0022]\n    F --\u003e J[\u0022\/videos\/{file} matches \/videos\/1080p5000_00001.m4s\u0022]\n    G --\u003e K[\u0022\/**.mpd matches \/content\/123\/india\/dash\/55\/manifest.mpd\u0022]\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n![AuthorizationPolicy Path Matching Wildcard Rules](dfe9a5d5e2bc91e91e7e24017f56a3db.svg)\n\nFor more on the specific applications and rules of path templates, you can refer to [Envoy\u0027s official documentation](https:\/\/www.envoyproxy.io\/docs\/envoy\/latest\/api-v3\/extensions\/path\/match\/uri_template\/v3\/uri_template_match.proto).\n\n{{\u003c callout note \u0022Tip\u0022\u003e}}\n\u0060AuthorizationPolicy\u0060 finally supports templates in path matching, so you no longer need to manually add paths one by one in your configurations.\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Istio 1.22 release introduces several important updates and improvements. Although some features are widely publicized, they require detailed assessment and appropriate testing in practical use. Hopefully, this blog post helps you understand and apply these new features more deeply to achieve the best results in practice.\n\n## References\n\n- [Gateway API v1.1: Service mesh, GRPCRoute, and a whole lot more - kubernetes.io](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/blog\/2024\/05\/09\/gateway-api-v1-1\/)\n\n---\n\nThis blog was initially published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/istio-service-mesh-new-features-v1_22\/).', '\/en\/blog\/what-is-new-in-istio-1-22\/')">

According to [Tetrate\u0027s discussion](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/do-i-need-a-gateway-or-a-service-mesh\/), the choice depends on the type of network traffic: north-south or east-west. For services primarily handling external requests, Envoy Gateway is the ideal choice. It not only efficiently manages traffic but also seamlessly integrates as you transition to a microservices architecture.\n\nThis article explores the advantages of deploying Envoy Gateway on Kubernetes, its relationship with other service mesh components, and why it\u0027s the ideal choice for exposing services to the public internet.\n\n## Overview of Envoy Gateway and its Role in Service Mesh\n\nEnvoy Gateway is a Kubernetes-native API gateway built around Envoy Proxy. It aims to lower the barrier for users adopting Envoy as an API gateway and lays the foundation for vendors to build value-added products like [Tetrate Enterprise Gateway for Envoy](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/tetrate-enterprise-gateway-for-envoy\/).\n\nEnvoy Gateway is not only an ideal choice for managing north-south traffic but also serves as a crucial component for connecting and securing services within the service mesh. It enhances communication efficiency and security among microservices by providing features such as secure data transmission, traffic routing, load balancing, and fault recovery. Leveraging its built-in Envoy Proxy technology, Envoy Gateway can handle a large number of concurrent connections and complex traffic management policies while maintaining low latency and high throughput.\n\nFurthermore, the tight integration of Envoy Gateway with the Kubernetes Gateway API allows for declarative configuration and management, significantly simplifying the deployment and update processes of gateways within the service mesh. This integration not only improves operational efficiency but also enables Envoy Gateway to seamlessly collaborate with solutions like Istio without adding extra complexity.\n\nThe figure below illustrates the relationship between Envoy Gateway and the service mesh.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060mermaid\ngraph TB\n    subgraph Kubernetes[\u0022Kubernetes Cluster\u0022]\n        eg[\u0022Envoy Gateway\u0022]\n        svcs[\u0022Services\u0022]\n        pods[\u0022Pods\u0022]\n        gwapi[\u0022Kubernetes Gateway API\u0022]\n        eg -- \u0022Manages North-South Traffic\u0022 --\u003e svcs\n        eg -- \u0022Configured by\u0022 --\u003e gwapi\n        gwapi -. \u0022Defines routing specs\u0022 .-\u003e svcs\n    end\n\n    subgraph SM[\u0022Service Mesh\u0022]\n        smc[\u0022Service Mesh Control Plane (e.g., Istio, Linkerd)\u0022]\n        smp[\u0022Service Mesh Data Plane (Envoy Sidecars)\u0022]\n        smc -- \u0022Configures\u0022 --\u003e smp\n        smp -- \u0022Handles East-West Traffic\u0022 --\u003e pods\n    end\n\n    eg -.-\u003e smp\n    svcs -. \u0022Part of\u0022 .-\u003e SM\n    svcs -- \u0022Connects to\u0022 --\u003e pods\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n![Mermaid Diagram](17a407873a0c96afbde9bb6b252814d4.svg)\n\n\n\nIn a Kubernetes cluster, Envoy Gateway is responsible for managing north-south traffic, i.e., traffic entering and leaving the cluster, and is configured through the Kubernetes Gateway API, which defines routing specifications for services. Services within the cluster directly connect to pods. In the service mesh, the control plane (e.g., Istio or Linkerd) configures Envoy sidecars in the data plane, which handles east-west traffic within the cluster. In this system, Envoy Gateway can collaborate with the service mesh, but they independently manage traffic in different directions.\n\nThink of Envoy Gateway as the main entry point to a city (e.g., customs), where all traffic (like various vehicles) must pass through. It acts as a strict gatekeeper, responsible for inspection and guidance, ensuring each packet (like each passenger) is accurately delivered to its destination. In the city of Kubernetes, Envoy Gateway manages all inbound traffic, ensuring data flows securely and efficiently into the city and is accurately delivered to services within the city.\n\nOnce inside the city, the service mesh takes over, acting as a series of transportation networks within the city. Envoy sidecars in the service mesh are like taxis or buses within the city, responsible for transporting packets from the port to their specific destinations within the city. Envoy Gateway ensures smooth entry for external requests, and then the service mesh efficiently handles these requests within the cluster.\n\nThe support for Kubernetes Gateway API by Envoy Gateway can be seen as a significant upgrade to our city\u0027s traffic signal system. It not only provides clearer and more personalized guidance for incoming data flows but also makes the entire city\u0027s traffic operations more intelligent.\n\n## Core Features and Advantages of Envoy Gateway\n\nEnvoy Gateway offers several core features that make it a prominent choice for an API gateway:\n\n- **Simplified Configuration**: Through direct integration with the Kubernetes Gateway API, Envoy Gateway allows developers to use Kubernetes custom resources to declaratively configure routing rules, security policies, and traffic management.\n- **Performance and Scalability**: Built on battle-tested Envoy Proxy, it delivers outstanding performance and scalability, effortlessly handling thousands of services and millions of requests per second.\n- **Security Features**: Built-in support for various security measures such as SSL\/TLS termination, OAuth2, OIDC authentication, and fine-grained access control.\n- **Observability**: Provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities including detailed metrics, logs, and tracing, crucial for diagnosing and understanding traffic behavior.\n\n## Relationship with Gateway API\n\nThe introduction of the Gateway API in Kubernetes provides a powerful new way to integrate and configure ingress gateways, offering higher flexibility and functionality compared to traditional ingress. As discussed in [this blog](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/introducing-the-gateway-api\/), the Gateway API simplifies gateway management, allowing developers to define custom routing rules, TLS termination policies, and traffic policies using Kubernetes-native resources.\n\nThe Kubernetes Gateway API serves as the cornerstone of Envoy Gateway, providing a more expressive, flexible, and role-based approach to configuring gateways and routes within the Kubernetes ecosystem. This API offers custom resource definitions (CRDs) such as GatewayClass, Gateway, HTTPRoute, etc. Envoy Gateway utilizes these resources to create a user-friendly and consistent configuration model that aligns with Kubernetes\u0027 native principles.\n\n{{\u003ccallout note \u0022What is an API Gateway?\u0022\u003e}}\n\nAn API Gateway is a comprehensive management and hosting service for APIs. Serving as an intermediary layer between applications and backend services, it not only handles lifecycle events like creation, maintenance, deployment, running, and retiring but also performs additional critical functions. A robust API Gateway should provide the following features to enhance and extend its basic definition:\n\n1. **Traffic Control**: Ability to manage and control traffic to backend services, including request routing, load balancing, circuit breaking, and rate limiting, ensuring the stability and high availability of backend services.\n2. **Security Assurance**: Authentication, authorization, and encryption capabilities to effectively manage and protect API security. This involves authentication mechanisms, API key management, OAuth, JWT, mTLS, etc., ensuring that only authorized users and services can access the API.\n3. **Monitoring and Analytics**: Real-time monitoring and logging functionalities to track API usage, performance metrics, anomaly detection, and traffic pattern analysis, optimizing API performance and responsiveness.\n4. **Change Management**: Support for managing API changes, including version control and progressive deployment (such as blue-green or canary release), for seamless transition to new versions while minimizing impact on end users.\n5. **Request and Response Transformation**: Allow transformation of incoming and outgoing API calls, such as from REST to GraphQL, or adding, removing, and modifying request and response headers.\n6. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Support**: Manage and control cross-origin requests, allowing frontend applications from different domains to securely call backend APIs.\n7. **Quotas and Billing**: Set quota limits for API usage, while also supporting billing functionalities for commercialized API offerings.\n8. **Developer-Friendly Developer Portal**: Provide a developer-facing portal, enabling third-party developers to easily discover, test, and integrate APIs.\n9. **Protocol Support**: Support for various network protocols, including HTTP\/HTTPS, WebSocket, gRPC, etc., ensuring compatibility with a variety of clients and services.\n10. **Plug-ability and Extensibility**: Allow extension of API Gateway functionality through plugins or middleware, enabling flexible adaptation to various middleware services based on business requirements.\n11. **Service Governance**: Integration with service registration and discovery mechanisms to accommodate the dynamics of services in a microservices architecture.\n\nIn conclusion, the role of an API Gateway extends far beyond simple API lifecycle management. It is a key component in realizing microservices architecture, ensuring service security, improving operational efficiency, and optimizing user experience. Through these extensive functionalities, the API Gateway becomes an indispensable part of modern cloud-native applications.\n\n{{\u003c\/callout\u003e}}\n\n## Overview of Envoy Gateway Architecture\n\nThe architecture of Envoy Gateway is designed to be lightweight and concise. It consists of a control plane that dynamically configures an Envoy proxy running as the data plane. This separation of concerns ensures that the gateway can scale with increasing traffic without affecting the efficiency of the control plane.\n\nThe architecture diagram of Envoy Gateway is shown below.\n\n![Envoy Gateway Architecture Diagram](envoy-gateway-arch.svg)\n\nAt the core of this architecture is the Envoy Gateway, which is an instance of the Envoy proxy responsible for handling all traffic in and out of the Kubernetes cluster. Upon initial startup, Envoy Gateway provides static configuration through configuration files, establishing the basic parameters of its operation.\n\nThe dynamic aspect of Envoy Gateway configuration is handled by providers, which define the interaction between the gateway and Kubernetes or other dynamic configuration input sources. The resource monitor is responsible for monitoring changes to Kubernetes resources, with particular attention to CRUD operations related to custom resource definitions (CRDs).\n\nAs changes occur, resource transformers intervene to translate these external resources into a form understandable by Envoy Gateway. This transformation process is further facilitated by provider-specific infrastructure managers, which are responsible for managing resources related to specific clouds or infrastructure providers, shaping the infrastructure into an intermediate representation crucial for the gateway\u0027s functionality.\n\nThis intermediate representation then transforms into the xDS intermediate representation, serving as the precursor to the final xDS configuration understood and executed by Envoy. The xDS translator plays the role of converting this intermediate representation into specific xDS configurations.\n\nThese configurations are delivered and executed by xDS servers, which act as services diligently managing Envoy instances based on the xDS configurations they receive. As the actual running proxy, Envoy ultimately receives these configurations from xDS servers, interprets them, and implements them to effectively manage traffic requests.\n\nUltimately, all requests are redirected to the final destination of Envoy Gateway routes for traffic, which are the backend services.\n\n## Comparison with Other Gateways\n\nCompared to other popular solutions such as Istio\u0027s Ingress Gateway or NGINX Ingress, Envoy Gateway stands out with its native integration with Kubernetes and its focus on leveraging the full potential of Envoy. The table below compares various open-source API gateways from multiple aspects.\n\n| **API Gateway** | **Supported Authentication \u0026 Authorization Strategies**      | **Supported Service Discovery Components** | **Supported Protocols**          | **Control Plane Configuration Distribution Method** | **Supported Plugin Extension Mechanism** | **Foundation Affiliation** |\n| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| Envoy Gateway   | OAuth2, JWT, mTLS, OIDC                                      | Kubernetes, EDS                            | HTTP, HTTPS, gRPC                | xDS                                                 | Envoy Filter Based                       | CNCF                       |\n| Kuma            | mTLS, JWT                                                    | Kubernetes, Consul                         | HTTP, HTTPS, gRPC, TCP           | REST, gRPC                                          | Lua, Go Based                            | CNCF                       |\n| NGINX Ingress   | RBAC                                                         | Kubernetes                                 | HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP            | Kubernetes CRD                                      | Nginx Module Based                       | N\/A                        |\n| APISIX          | OAuth2, JWT, Key Auth, Basic Auth, mTLS, OIDC, LDAP, OpenID, and others | Kubernetes, DNS, Consul, Nacos, Eureka     | HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP, WebSocket | REST, CLI, Web UI                                   | Lua, Wasm Based                          | Apache Software Foundation |\n| Kong            | OAuth2, JWT, Basic Auth, Key Auth                            | Kubernetes, DNS, Consul                    | HTTP, HTTPS, gRPC, WebSocket     | REST, gRPC, Web UI                                  | Lua Based                                | N\/A                        |\n| Emissary        | Basic Auth                                                   | Kubernetes                                 | HTTP, HTTPS, gRPC                | Kubernetes CRD                                      | Lua, Go Based                            | CNCF                       |\n\n## Quick Start with Envoy Gateway\n\nTo quickly get started with Envoy Gateway, you can set up a local experimental environment using the following simplified steps. First, start a local Kubernetes cluster:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nminikube start --driver=docker --cpus=2 --memory=2g\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nNext, deploy the Gateway API CRD and Envoy Gateway itself:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nhelm install eg oci:\/\/docker.io\/envoyproxy\/gateway-helm --version v1.0.1 -n envoy-gateway-system --create-namespace\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThen, install the gateway configuration and deploy a sample application:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl apply -f https:\/\/github.com\/envoyproxy\/gateway\/releases\/download\/v1.0.1\/quickstart.yaml -n default\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nTo expose the LoadBalancer service, here we use port forwarding as an example. You can also choose to use \u0060minikube tunnel\u0060 or install [MetalLB](https:\/\/metallb.universe.tf\/installation\/) as a load balancer:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nexport ENVOY_SERVICE=$(kubectl get svc -n envoy-gateway-system --selector=gateway.envoyproxy.io\/owning-gateway-namespace=default,gateway.envoyproxy.io\/owning-gateway-name=eg -o jsonpath=\u0027{.items[0].metadata.name}\u0027)\nkubectl -n envoy-gateway-system port-forward service\/${ENVOY_SERVICE} 8888:80 \u0026\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nTest if your Envoy Gateway is working properly with the following command:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\ncurl --verbose --header \u0022Host: www.example.com\u0022 http:\/\/localhost:8888\/get\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nFor more detailed installation and configuration steps, visit the Envoy Gateway website. With these steps, you can quickly start exploring the capabilities of Envoy Gateway.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEnvoy Gateway not only optimizes Layer 7 gateway configuration in the cloud-native era but also provides a smooth transition from edge gateways to service meshes. As the promotion of service meshes faces some challenges, such as the intrusiveness to applications and issues driving by operations teams, edge gateways are more readily accepted by development teams. Envoy Gateway, with its simplified Kubernetes Gateway API, enhances traffic management and observability capabilities. Additionally, the transition from Envoy Gateway to Istio is a confident technical advancement for teams already familiar with Envoy features, supporting seamless switching from the standard Kubernetes Gateway API to Istio Ingress Gateway or continuing to collaborate with Istio as a custom solution. These features make Envoy Gateway a gateway choice worth investing in the cloud-native era.\n\nStay tuned for the subsequent parts of this blog series, where we will delve into configuring and optimizing Envoy Gateway, providing practical guides, and showcasing a wider range of real-world use cases.\n\n---\n\nThis blog was initially published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/envoy-microservices-overview\/).\n', '\/en\/blog\/envoy-gateway-introduction\/')">

This is where distributed tracing comes into play.\n\nThis article covers:\n\n- How distributed tracing works\n- How to choose distributed tracing software\n- How to use distributed tracing in Istio\n- How to view distributed tracing data using Bookinfo and SkyWalking as examples\n\n## Distributed Tracing Basics\n\nDistributed tracing is a method for tracing requests in a distributed system to help users better understand, control, and optimize distributed systems. There are two concepts used in distributed tracing: TraceID and SpanID. You can see them in Figure 1 below.\n\n- **TraceID** is a globally unique ID that identifies the trace information of a request. All traces of a request belong to the same TraceID, and the TraceID remains constant throughout the trace of the request.\n- **SpanID** is a locally unique ID that identifies a request’s trace information at a certain time. A request generates different SpanIDs at different periods, and SpanIDs are used to distinguish trace information for a request at different periods.\n\nTraceID and SpanID are the basis of distributed tracing. They provide a uniform identifier for request tracing in distributed systems and facilitate users’ ability to query, manage, and analyze the trace information of requests.\n\n![Figure 1: Trace and span](basic.svg)\n\nThe following is the process of distributed tracing:\n\n- When a system receives a request, the distributed tracing system assigns a TraceID to the request, which is used to chain together the entire chain of invocations.\n- The distributed trace system generates a SpanID and ParentID for each service call within the system for the request, which is used to record the parent-child relationship of the call; a Span without a ParentID is used as the entry point of the call chain.\n- TraceID and SpanID are to be passed during each service call.\n- When viewing a distributed trace, query the full process of a particular request by TraceID.\n\n## How Istio Implements Distributed Tracing\n\nIstio’s distributed tracing is based on information collected by the Envoy proxy in the data plane. After a service request is intercepted by Envoy, Envoy adds tracing information as headers to the request forwarded to the destination workload. The following headers are relevant for distributed tracing:\n\n- As TraceID: x-request-id\n- Used to establish parent-child relationships for Span in the LightStep trace: x-ot-span-context\u003c\/li\n- Used for Zipkin, also for Jaeger, SkyWalking, see [b3-propagation](https:\/\/github.com\/openzipkin\/b3-propagation):\n  - *x-b3-traceid*\n  - *x-b3-traceid*\n  - *x-b3-spanid*\n  - *x-b3-parentspanid*\n  - *x-b3-sampled*\n  - *x-b3-flags*\n  - *b3*\n- For Datadog:\n  - *x-datadog-trace-id*\n  - *x-datadog-parent-id*\n  - *x-datadog-sampling-priority*\n- For SkyWalking: *sw8*\n- For AWS X-Ray: *x-amzn-trace-id*\n\nFor more information on how to use these headers, please see the [Envoy documentation](https:\/\/www.envoyproxy.io\/docs\/envoy\/latest\/configuration\/http\/http_conn_man\/headers).\n\nRegardless of the language of your application, Envoy will generate the appropriate tracing headers for you at the [Ingress Gateway](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/learn\/kubernetes\/what-is-kubernetes-ingress\/) and forward these headers to the upstream cluster. However, in order to utilize the distributed tracing feature, you must modify your application code to attach the tracing headers to upstream requests. Since neither the service mesh nor the application can automatically propagate these headers, you can integrate the agent for distributed tracing into the application or manually propagate these headers in the application code itself. Once the tracing headers are propagated to all upstream requests, Envoy will send the tracing data to the tracer’s back-end processing, and then you can view the tracing data in the UI.\n\nFor example, look at the code of the Productpage service in the [Bookinfo application](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/examples\/bookinfo\/). You can see that it integrates the Jaeger client library and synchronizes the header generated by Envoy with the HTTP requests to the Details and Reviews services in the *getForwardHeaders (request)* function.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060python\ndef getForwardHeaders(request):\n    headers = {}\n\n    # Using Jaeger agent to get the x-b3-* headers\n    span = get_current_span()\n    carrier = {}\n    tracer.inject(\n        span_context=span.context,\n        format=Format.HTTP_HEADERS,\n        carrier=carrier)\n\n    headers.update(carrier)\n\n    # Dealing with the non x-b3-* header manually\n    if \u0027user\u0027 in session:\n        headers[\u0027end-user\u0027] = session[\u0027user\u0027]\n    incoming_headers = [\n        \u0027x-request-id\u0027,\n        \u0027x-ot-span-context\u0027,\n        \u0027x-datadog-trace-id\u0027,\n        \u0027x-datadog-parent-id\u0027,\n        \u0027x-datadog-sampling-priority\u0027,\n        \u0027traceparent\u0027,\n        \u0027tracestate\u0027,\n        \u0027x-cloud-trace-context\u0027,\n        \u0027grpc-trace-bin\u0027,\n        \u0027sw8\u0027,\n        \u0027user-agent\u0027,\n        \u0027cookie\u0027,\n        \u0027authorization\u0027,\n        \u0027jwt\u0027,\n    ]\n\n    for ihdr in incoming_headers:\n        val = request.headers.get(ihdr)\n        if val is not None:\n            headers[ihdr] = val\n\n    return headers\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nFor more information, the [Istio documentation](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/about\/faq\/#distributed-tracing) provides answers to frequently asked questions about distributed tracing in Istio.\n\n## How to Choose A Distributed Tracing System\n\nDistributed tracing systems are similar in principle. There are many such systems on the market, such as [Apache SkyWalking](https:\/\/github.com\/apache\/skywalking), [Jaeger](https:\/\/github.com\/jaegertracing\/jaeger), [Zipkin](https:\/\/github.com\/openzipkin\/zipkin\/), Lightstep, [Pinpoint](https:\/\/github.com\/pinpoint-apm\/pinpoint), and so on. For our purposes here, we will choose three of them and compare them in several dimensions. Here are our inclusion criteria:\n\n- They are currently the most popular open-source distributed tracing systems.\n- All are based on the OpenTracing specification.\n- They support integration with Istio and Envoy.\n\n| Items               | Apache SkyWalking                                            | Jaeger                                       | Zipkin                                       |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| Implementations     | Language-based probes, service mesh probes, eBPF agent, third-party instrumental libraries (Zipkin currently supported) | Language-based probes                        | Language-based probes                        |\n| Database            | ES, H2, MySQL, TiDB, Sharding-sphere, BanyanDB               | ES, MySQL, Cassandra, Memory                 | ES, MySQL, Cassandra, Memory                 |\n| Supported Languages | Java, Rust, PHP, NodeJS, Go, Python, C\u002b\u002b, .Net, Lua          | Java, Go, Python, NodeJS, C#, PHP, Ruby, C\u002b\u002b | Java, Go, Python, NodeJS, C#, PHP, Ruby, C\u002b\u002b |\n| Initiator           | Personal                                                     | Uber                                         | Twitter                                      |\n| Governance          | Apache Foundation                                            | CNCF                                         | CNCF                                         |\n| Version             | 9.3.0                                                        | 1.39.0                                       | 2.23.19                                      |\n| Stars               | 20.9k                                                        | 16.8k                                        | 15.8k                                        |\n\nAlthough Apache SkyWalking’s agent does not support as many languages as Jaeger and Zipkin, SkyWalking’s implementation is richer and compatible with Jaeger and Zipkin trace data, and development is more active, so it is one of the best choices for building a telemetry platform.\n\n## Demo\n\nRefer to the [Istio documentation](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/tasks\/observability\/distributed-tracing\/skywalking\/) to install and configure Apache SkyWalking.\n\n### Environment Description\n\nThe following is the environment for our demo:\n\n- Kubernetes 1.24.5\n- Istio 1.16\n- SkyWalking 9.1.0\n\n### Install Istio\n\nBefore installing Istio, you can check the environment for any problems:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\n$ istioctl experimental precheck\n✔ No issues found when checking the cluster. Istio is safe to install or upgrade!\n  To get started, check out https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/setup\/getting-started\/\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThen install Istio and configure the destination for sending tracing messages as SkyWalking:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\n# Initial Istio Operator\nistioctl operator init\n# Configure tracing destination\nkubectl apply -f - \u003c\u003cEOF\napiVersion: install.istio.io\/v1alpha1\nkind: IstioOperator\nmetadata:\n  namespace: istio-system\n  name: istio-with-skywalking\nspec:\n  meshConfig:\n    defaultProviders:\n      tracing:\n      - \u0022skywalking\u0022\n    enableTracing: true\n    extensionProviders:\n    - name: \u0022skywalking\u0022\n      skywalking:\n        service: tracing.istio-system.svc.cluster.local\n        port: 11800\nEOF\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## Deploy Apache SkyWalking\n\nIstio 1.16 supports distributed tracing using Apache SkyWalking. Install SkyWalking by executing the following code:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl apply -f \nhttps:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/istio\/istio\/release-1.16\/samples\/addons\/extras\/skywalking.yaml\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nIt will install the following components under the *istio-system* namespace:\n\n- SkyWalking Observability Analysis Platform (OAP): Used to receive trace data, supports SkyWalking native data formats, Zipkin v1 and v2 and Jaeger format.\n- UI: Used to query distributed trace data.\n\nFor more information about SkyWalking, please refer to the SkyWalking documentation.\n\n## Deploy the Bookinfo Application\n\nExecute the following command to install the bookinfo application:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled\nkubectl apply -f samples\/bookinfo\/platform\/kube\/bookinfo.yaml\nkubectl apply -f samples\/bookinfo\/networking\/bookinfo-gateway.yaml\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nLaunch the SkyWalking UI:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nistioctl dashboard skywalking\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nFigure 2 shows all the services available in the bookinfo application:\n\n![Figure 2: SkyWalking General Service page](general-service.jpg)\n\nYou can also see information about instances, endpoints, topology, tracing, etc. For example, Figure 3 shows the service topology of the bookinfo application:\n\n![Figure 3: Topology diagram of the Bookinfo application](topology.jpg)\n\nTracing views in SkyWalking can be displayed in a variety of formats, including list, tree, table, and statistics. See Figure 4:\n\n![Figure 4: SkyWalking General Service trace supports multiple display formats](gs-styles.jpg)\n\nTo facilitate our examination, set the sampling rate of the trace to 100%:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nkubectl apply -f - \u003c\u003cEOF\napiVersion: telemetry.istio.io\/v1alpha1\nkind: Telemetry\nmetadata:\n  name: mesh-default\n  namespace: istio-system\nspec:\n  tracing:\n  - randomSamplingPercentage: 100.00\nEOF\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n\u003e **Important:** *It’s generally not good practice to set the sampling rate to 100% in a production environment. To avoid the overhead of generating too many trace logs in production, please adjust the sampling strategy (sampling percentage).*\n\n## Uninstall\n\nAfter experimenting, uninstall Istio and SkyWalking by executing the following command.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nsamples\/bookinfo\/platform\/kube\/cleanup.sh\nistioctl unintall --purge\nkubectl delete namespace istio-system\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## Understanding the Bookinfo Tracing Information\n\nNavigate to the General Service tab in the Apache SkyWalking UI, and you can see the trace information for the most recent *istio-ingressgateway* service, as shown in Figure 5. Click on each span to see the details.\n\n![Figure 5: The table view shows the basic information about each span.](span-table.jpg)\n\nSwitching to the list view, you can see the execution order and duration of each span, as shown in Figure 6:\n\n![Figure 6: List display](trace-list.jpg)\n\nYou might want to know why such a straightforward application generates so much span data. Because after we inject the Envoy proxy into the pod, every request between services will be intercepted and processed by Envoy, as shown in Figure 7:\n\n![Figure 7: Envoy intercepts requests to generate a span](span.svg)\n\nThe tracing process is shown in Figure 8:\n\n![Figure 8: Trace of the Bookinfo application](bookinfo-spans-with-time.svg)\n\nWe give each span a label with a serial number, and the time taken is indicated in parentheses. For illustration purposes, we have summarized all spans in the table below.\n\n| No.  | Endpoint     | Total Duration (ms) | Component Duration (ms) | Current Service      | Description                                 |\n| ---- | ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |\n| 1    | \/productpage | 190                 | 0                       | istio-ingressgateway | Envoy Outbound                              |\n| 2    | \/productpage | 190                 | 1                       | istio-ingressgateway | Ingress -\u003e Productpage network transmission |\n| 3    | \/productpage | 189                 | 1                       | productpage          | Envoy Inbound                               |\n| 4    | \/productpage | 188                 | 21                      | productpage          | Application internal processing             |\n| 5    | \/details\/0   | 8                   | 1                       | productpage          | Envoy Outbound                              |\n| 6    | \/details\/0   | 7                   | 3                       | productpage          | Productpage -\u003e Details network transmission |\n| 7    | \/details\/0   | 4                   | 0                       | details              | Envoy Inbound                               |\n| 8    | \/details\/0   | 4                   | 4                       | details              | Application internal processing             |\n| 9    | \/reviews\/0   | 159                 | 0                       | productpage          | Envoy Outbound                              |\n| 10   | \/reviews\/0   | 159                 | 14                      | productpage          | Productpage -\u003e Reviews network transmission |\n| 11   | \/reviews\/0   | 145                 | 1                       | reviews              | Envoy Inbound                               |\n| 12   | \/reviews\/0   | 144                 | 109                     | reviews              | Application internal processing             |\n| 13   | \/ratings\/0   | 35                  | 2                       | reviews              | Envoy Outbound                              |\n| 14   | \/ratings\/0   | 33                  | 16                      | reviews              | Reviews -\u003e Ratings network transmission     |\n| 15   | \/ratings\/0   | 17                  | 1                       | ratings              | Envoy Inbound                               |\n| 16   | \/ratings\/0   | 16                  | 16                      | ratings              | Application internal processing             |\n\nFrom the above information, it can be seen that:\n\n- The total time consumed for this request is 190 ms.\n- In Istio sidecar mode, each traffic flow in and out of the application container must pass through the Envoy proxy once, each time taking 0 to 2 ms.\n- Network requests between Pods take between 1 and 16ms.\n- This is because the data itself has errors and the start time of the Span is not necessarily equal to the end time of the parent Span.\n- We can see that the most time-consuming part is the Reviews application, which takes 109 ms so that we can optimize it for that application.\n\n## Summary\n\nDistributed tracing is an indispensable tool for analyzing performance and troubleshooting modern distributed applications. In this tutorial, we’ve seen how, with just a few minor changes to your application code to propagate tracing headers, Istio makes distributed tracing simple to use. We’ve also reviewed [Apache SkyWalking](https:\/\/skywalking.apache.org\/) as one of the best distributed tracing systems that Istio supports. It is a fully functional platform for cloud native application analytics, with features such as metrics and log collection, alerting, Kubernetes monitoring, [service mesh performance diagnosis using eBPF](https:\/\/skywalking.apache.org\/blog\/diagnose-service-mesh-network-performance-with-ebpf\/), and more.\n\n---\n\nIf you’re new to service mesh and Kubernetes security, we have a bunch of free online courses [available at Tetrate Academy](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/academy) that will quickly get you up to speed with Istio and Envoy.\n\nIf you’re looking for a fast way to get to production with Istio, check out [Tetrate Istio Distribution (TID)](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/tid). TID is Tetrate’s hardened, fully upstream Istio distribution, with FIPS-verified builds and support available. It’s a great way to get started with Istio knowing you have a trusted distribution to begin with, have an expert team supporting you, and also have the option to get to FIPS compliance quickly if you need to.\n\nOnce you have Istio up and running, you will probably need simpler ways to manage and secure your services beyond what’s available in Istio, that’s where Tetrate Service Bridge comes in. You can learn more about how Tetrate Service Bridge makes service mesh more secure, manageable, and resilient [here](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/tsb), or [contact us for a quick demo](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/contact).\n\n*This blog was originally published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/how-to-use-skywalking-for-distributed-tracing-in-istio\/).*\n', '\/en\/blog\/distributed-tracing-with-skywalking-in-istio\/')">

This reduces the attack surface of network communication by using strong identities to establish encrypted channels between workloads within the mesh that are both confidential and tamper-resistant. mTLS is a key component for building zero-trust application networks. To understand mTLS traffic encryption in Istio, this article will cover the following:\n\n- An overview of TLS, mTLS, and TLS termination\n- An introduction to howTLS encryption works in Istio\n- How to use Istio to implement mTLS in Kubernetes\n- A discussion of when you do and don’t need mTLS\n\n## What Is TLS and mTLS?\n\nTLS, the successor to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), is a widely adopted security protocol used to create authenticated and encrypted connections between networked computers. For this reason, people often use the terms TLS and SSL interchangeably. In this article, we will refer to them collectively as TLS. TLS 1.0 was released in 1999, and the latest version is 1.3 (released in August 2018); versions 1.0 and 1.1 are deprecated.\n\nThe HTTPS we see when browsing the web uses TLS, as shown in Figure 1, which is built on top of TCP as the session layer in the OSI model. To ensure compatibility, TLS usually uses port 443, but you can use any port you want.\n\n![Figure 1: HTTP vs. HTTPS](http-vs-https.svg)\n\nTLS encryption is required when a client needs to confirm the identity of the server in order to guard against man-in-the-middle attacks and ensure communication security. Figure 2 shows how TLS-encrypted communication proceeds.\n\n![Figure 2: simplified TLS handshake flow](tls-flow.svg)\n\n1. The server applies for and obtains a certificate (X.509 certificate) from a trusted [certificate authority](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Certificate_authority) (CA).\n2. A request from the client to the server containing information such as the TLS version and password combination supported by the client.\n3. The server responds to the client request and attaches a digital certificate.\n4. The client verifies the status, validity, and digital signature of the certificate and confirms the identity of the server.\n5. Encrypted communication commences between the client and the server using a shared private key.\n\nThe above is only an outline description of the TLS communication flow. If you’re interested in the details, please see [this in-depth discussion of the complete TLS handshake process.](https:\/\/www.cloudflare.com\/learning\/ssl\/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake\/)\n\nFrom the above process, you will find that the certificate is the critical element representing the server’s identity. The server must use a certificate issued by an authoritatively certified CA in order to provide public services over the Internet. In contrast, you can manage certificates using your own public key infrastructure (PKI) for services inside of a private environment.\n\nMutual TLS, also referred to as mTLS, is the use of a two-way encrypted channel between a server and a client that necessitates certificate exchange and identity authentication between the parties.\n\n## What Is TLS Termination?\n\nTLS termination is the process of decrypting TLS-encrypted traffic before it is forwarded to a web server. Offloading TLS traffic to an ingress gateway or specialized device improves web application performance while securing encrypted traffic. TLS termination is typically implemented at cluster ingress. All communication between the ingress and servers in the cluster will be conducted directly over HTTP in plaintext, enhancing service performance.\n\n![Figure 3: TLS termination](tls-termination.svg)\n\nBy default, Istio enables mTLS for mesh-based services and ends TLS at the ingress gateway. Furthermore, you can pass through traffic to back-end services for processing.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: networking.istio.io\/v1beta1\nkind: Gateway\nmetadata:\n  name: sample-gateway\nspec:\n  servers:\n  - port:\n      number: 443\n      name: https\n      protocol: HTTPS\n    tls:\n      mode: PASSTHROUGH\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nSee [Gateway TLS Configuration](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/ops\/configuration\/traffic-management\/tls-configuration\/#gateways) for details.\n\n## How to Implement Automatic mTLS in Istio\n\nFigure 4 depicts the security architecture of Istio. This figure clearly shows that at the entry point, JSON Web Token (JWT) \u002b TLS authentication and encryption are used, and that mTLS is enabled between all services within the Istio mesh.\n\n![Istio 安全架构图](istio-security.svg)\n\nIstio includes a built-in CA, and [Secret Discovery Service (SDS)](https:\/\/www.envoyproxy.io\/docs\/envoy\/latest\/configuration\/security\/secret)—one of the discovery services in Envoy [xDS](https:\/\/www.envoyproxy.io\/docs\/envoy\/latest\/api-docs\/xds_protocol)—enables the issuance and rotation of SVID certificates. The mTLS flow in the Istio mesh is as follows:\n\n1. The sidecar of every service requests a certificate from Istiod on behalf of the workload at startup, and Istiod issues the [SVID](https:\/\/spiffe.io\/docs\/latest\/spiffe-about\/spiffe-concepts\/#spiffe-verifiable-identity-document-svid) certificate (the process is more complex, and I will explain it in a future blog).\n2. The sidecar of every workload intercepts all client requests within the pod.\n3. The client sidecar starts an mTLS handshake with the server sidecar. During the handshake, the [JWT](https:\/\/www.envoyproxy.io\/docs\/envoy\/latest\/intro\/arch_overview\/security\/jwt_authn_filter) and [authentication filter](https:\/\/www.envoyproxy.io\/docs\/envoy\/latest\/intro\/arch_overview\/security\/ext_authz_filter) in the client sidecar will authenticate the identity of the request, and store the identity in the filter metadata after the authentication. Then the request will go through the authorization filter to determine if the request is allowed.\n4. If the request is authenticated and authorized, the client and the server start to establish a connection for communication.\n\nIn Istio, authentication and authorization between services can be configured using one of three resource objects:\n\n- **[RequestAuthentication](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/reference\/config\/security\/request_authentication\/):** To specify the service’s only currently supported request-level authentication method, JWT.\n- **[PeerAuthentication](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/reference\/config\/security\/peer_authentication\/):** To enable mTLS or plaintext requests, set the transport authentication mode.\n- **[AuthorizationPolicy](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/reference\/config\/security\/authorization-policy\/):** To specify who can do what when traffic between services is authorized? For instance, subject A either permits (ALLOW) or forbids (DENY) traffic from subject B.\n\n## How to Enable Automatic mTLS in Istio\n\nIn PeerAuthentication, you can specify the mTLS mode that will be used for the target workload. Peer authentication is supported in the following modes:\n\n- PERMISSIVE: The workload’s default setting that allows it to accept either mTLS or plain text traffic.\n- STRICT: The workload accepts only mTLS traffic.\n- DISABLE: Disable mTLS. From a security perspective, mTLS should not be disabled unless you have your own security solution.\n- UNSET: Inherited from the parent, with the following priority: service specific \u003e namespace scope \u003e mesh scope setting.\n\nIstio’s peer authentication uses *PERMISSIVE* mode by default, automatically sending *mTLS* traffic to these workloads and clear text traffic to workloads without a sidecar. After including Kubernetes services in the Istio mesh, we can use *PERMISSIVE* mode first to prevent services from failing *mTLS*. We can use one of two ways to enable strict mTLS mode for certain services:\n\n- Use PeerAuthentication to define how traffic is transferred between sidecars.\n- Use DestinationRule to define the TLS settings in the traffic routing policy.\n\nThe reviews service’s mTLS configuration in the default namespace can be seen in the example below.\n\n### Use PeerAuthentication to Set mTLS for Workloads\n\nFor instance, the following configuration can be used to specify that a workload under a namespace has strict mTLS enabled.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: security.istio.io\/v1beta1\nkind: PeerAuthentication\nmetadata:\n  name: foo-peer-policy\n  namespace: default\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: reviews\n  mtls:\n    mode: STRICT\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nAccording to the [Istio documentation](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/tasks\/security\/authentication\/mtls-migration\/), you can also enable strict mTLS for all services in the mesh by configuring strict mTLS for the namespace istio-system where Istio is installed.\n\n### Use DestinationRule to Set up mTLS for Workloads\n\nTraffic routing policies, such as load balancing, anomaly detection, TLS settings, etc., are set using DestinationRule. In the TLS settings, there are various modes. As shown below, use ISTIO_MUTUAL mode to enable Istio’s workload-based automatic TLS.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: networking.istio.io\/v1beta1\nkind: DestinationRule\nmetadata:\n  name: reviews\n  namespace: default\nspec:\n  host: reviews\n  trafficPolicy:\n    tls:\n      mode: ISTIO_MUTUAL\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## When Should You Use mTLS?\n\nThe short answer is that you should use mTLS for network communication between application components that you have some control over—like between microservices in a cluster.\n\nOne-way TLS is typically used by Internet clients to connect to Web services, which means that only the server needs to show identification and is unconcerned with the identity of the client. One-way TLS allows you to use passwords, tokens, two-factor authentication, and other methods when you need to confirm the identity of the client. However, when using a service mesh, mTLS operates outside the application and doesn’t require many changes to the application logic, whereas such an authentication method requires internal application support.\n\nAs you can see from the example above, mTLS implementation calls for certificate exchange between services. As the number of services rises, managing numerous certificates becomes a laborious task. You can implement automatic mTLS and fix the certificate management issue with the aid of a service mesh.\n\n## When Shouldn’t You Use mTLS?\n\nAlthough mTLS is the preferred protocol for securing inter-service communication in cloud-native applications, implementing mTLS necessitates a more complex, symmetric encryption and decryption process than one-way TLS. In some cases where there is high traffic volume or CPU utilization must be optimized, terminatingTLS at the traffic entry point and turning on mTLS internally for specific services only can help minimize request response times and decrease compute resource consumption for some traffic with lower security levels.\n\nAdditionally, it is necessary to [disable probe rewriting for pods](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/ops\/configuration\/mesh\/app-health-check\/#disable-the-http-probe-rewrite-for-a-pod) when using services that cannot obtain certificates, such as health checks performed via HTTP on Kubelet and the inability to access the service’s health check endpoint via TLS.\n\nFinally, when mesh services access some external services, mTLS is also not necessary.\n\n## Summary\n\nmTLS is a crucial component of creating a zero-trust application network, which makes it possible to encrypt traffic within the mesh. Istio makes it simple to enable automatic mTLS for Kubernetes services, doing away with the need to manage certificates. At the same time, we can selectively enable mTLS for a subset of the mesh’s services, enabling us to move services from Kubernetes to the mesh. In a subsequent blog, we’ll go into more detail about Istio’s certificate management system. Stay tuned.\n\n---\n\nIf you’re new to service mesh and Kubernetes security, we have a bunch of free online courses [available at Tetrate Academy](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/academy) that will quickly get you up to speed with Istio and Envoy.\n\nIf you’re looking for a fast way to get to production with Istio, check out [Tetrate Istio Distribution (TID)](https:\/\/tetr8.io\/tid). TID is Tetrate’s hardened, fully upstream Istio distribution, with FIPS-verified builds and support available.

              <a href="#" onclick="exportToMarkdown('Why the Gateway API Is the Unified Future of Ingress for Kubernetes and Service Mesh', 'This article introduces the ingress gateway and Gateway API in Kubernetes, the new trend of them with service mesh.', '\nIn this blog, you will learn about the Kubernetes Ingress Gateway, the Gateway API, and the emerging Gateway API trend, which enables the convergence of Kubernetes and service mesh.\n\n## Takeaways\n\n- Ingress, the original gateway for Kubernetes, has a resource model that is too simple to fit into today’s programmable networks.\n- The [Gateway API](https:\/\/gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io\/), the latest addition to the Kubernetes portal gateway, separates concerns through role delineation and provides cross-namespace support to make it more adaptable to multi-cloud environments. Most API gateways already support it.\n- The Gateway API provides a new reference model for the convergence of ingress gateways (north-south) and service mesh (east-west, cross-cluster routing), where there is a partial functional overlap.\n\n## History of the Kubernetes ingress gateway\n\nWhen Kubernetes was launched in June 2014, only NodePort and LoadBalancer-type Service objects were available to expose services within the cluster to the outside world. Later, [Ingress ](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/concepts\/services-networking\/ingress\/)was introduced to offer more control over incoming traffic. To preserve its portability and lightweight design, the Ingress API matured more slowly than other Kubernetes APIs; it was not upgraded to GA until Kubernetes 1.19.\n\nIngress’ primary objective is to expose HTTP applications using a straightforward declarative syntax. When creating an Ingress or setting a default *IngressClass* in Kubernetes, you can deploy several Ingress Controllers and define the controller the gateway uses via *IngressClass*. Kubernetes currently supports only AWS, GCE, and Nginx Ingress controllers by default; many [third-party ingress controllers](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/concepts\/services-networking\/ingress-controllers\/) are also supported.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the workflow of [Kubernetes Ingress](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/learn\/kubernetes\/what-is-kubernetes-ingress\/).\n\n![Figure 1: Kubernetes ingress workflow](ingress-flow.svg)\n\nThe detailed process is as follows:\n\n- Kubernetes cluster administrators deploy an Ingress Controller in Kubernetes.\n- The Ingress Controller continuously monitors changes to *IngressClass* and Ingress objects in the Kubernetes API Server.\n- Administrators apply *IngressClass* and Ingress to deploy the gateway.\n- Ingress Controller creates the corresponding ingress gateway and configures the routing rules according to the administrator’s configuration.\n- If in the cloud, the client accesses the load balancer for that ingress gateway.\n- The gateway will route the traffic to the corresponding back-end service based on the host and path in the HTTP request.\n\nIstio supports both the Ingress and Gateway APIs. Below is an example configuration using the Istio Ingress Gateway, which will be created later using the Gateway API:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io\/v1\nkind: IngressClass\nmetadata:\n  name: istio\nspec:\n  controller: istio.io\/ingress-controller\n---\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io\/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: ingress\nspec:\n  ingressClassName: istio\n  rules:\n  - host: httpbin.example.com\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: \/\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          service:\n            name: httpbin\n            port: 8000\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nNote: You must specify the *IngressClass* in the *ingressClassName* field in the Ingress spec. Otherwise, the ingress gateway will not be created.\n\n## Limitations of Kubernetes Ingress\n\nAlthough IngressClass decouples the ingress gateway from the back-end implementation, it still has significant limitations.\n\n- Ingress is too simple for most real-world use and it only supports HTTP protocol routing.\n- It only supports host and path matching, and there is no standard configuration for advanced routing features, which can only be achieved through annotation, such as URL redirection using Nginx Ingress Controller, which requires configuration of *nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io\/rewrite-target* annotation, which is no longer adaptable to the needs of a programmable proxy.\n- The situation where services in different namespaces must be bound to the same gateway often arises in practical situations where the ingress gateway cannot be shared across multiple namespaces.\n- No delineation of responsibilities for creating and managing ingress gateways, resulting in developers having to not only configure gateway routes but also create and manage gateways themselves.\n\n## Kubernetes Gateway API\n\nThe Gateway API is a collection of API resources: *GatewayClass*, *Gateway*, *HTTPRoute*, *TCPRoute*, *ReferenceGrant*, etc. The Gateway API exposes a more generic proxy API that can be used for more protocols than HTTP and models more infrastructure components, providing better deployment and management options for cluster operations.\n\nIn addition, the Gateway API achieves configuration decoupling by separating resource objects that people can manage in different roles. The following diagram shows the roles and objects in the Gateway API.\n\n![Figure: Roles and componentes in Kubernetes Gateway API](gateway-api-roles.svg)\n\nThe following is an example of using the Gateway API in Istio.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io\/v1alpha2\nkind: Gateway\nmetadata:\n  name: gateway\n  namespace: istio-ingress\nspec:\n  gatewayClassName: istio\n  listeners:\n  - name: default\n    hostname: \u0022*.example.com\u0022\n    port: 80\n    protocol: HTTP\n    allowedRoutes:\n      namespaces:\n        from: All\n---\napiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io\/v1alpha2\nkind: HTTPRoute\nmetadata:\n  name: http\n  namespace: default\nspec:\n  parentRefs:\n  - name: gateway\n    namespace: istio-ingress\n  hostnames: [\u0022httpbin.example.com\u0022]\n  rules:\n  - matches:\n    - path:\n        type: PathPrefix\n        value: \/\n    backendRefs:\n    - name: httpbin\n      port: 8000\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nSimilar to Ingress, Gateway uses *gatewayClassName* to declare the controller it uses, which needs to be created by the platform administrator and allows client requests for the **.example.com* domain. Application developers can create routing rules in the namespace where their service resides, in this case, default, and bind to the Gateway via parentRefs, but only if the Gateway explicitly allows them to do so (via the rules set in the *allowRoutes* field).\n\nWhen you apply the above configuration, Istio will automatically create a load-balancing gateway for you. The following diagram shows the workflow of the Gateway API.\n\n![Figure 3: Gateway API workflow](gateway-api-flow.svg)\n\nThe detailed process is as follows:\n\n- The infrastructure provider provides *GatewayClass* and Gateway Controller.\n- Platform operator deploy Gateway (multiple deployments possible, or using different *GatewayClasses*).\n- Gateway Controller continuously monitors changes to the *GatewayClass* and *Gateway* objects in the Kubernetes API Server.\n- Gateway controller will create the corresponding gateway based on cluster operations and maintenance configuration.\n- Application developers apply *xRoutes* and bind them to the service.\n- If in the cloud, the client accesses the load balancer for that ingress gateway.\n- The gateway will route to the corresponding back-end service based on the matching criteria in the traffic request.\n\nFrom the above steps, we can see that the Gateway API has a clear division of roles compared to Ingress and that routing rules can be decoupled from the gateway configuration, significantly increasing management flexibility.\n\nThe following diagram shows the route flow after it is accessed at the gateway and processed.\n\n![Figure 4: Gateway API route flow](traffic-flow.svg)\n\nFrom this figure, we can see that the route is bound to the gateway. The route is generally deployed in the same namespace as its backend services. Suppose the route is in a different namespace, and you need to explicitly give the route cross-namespace reference rights in \u0060ReferenceGrant\u0060, for example. In that case, the following HTTPRoute foo in the foo namespace can refer to the bar namespace bar service in the bar namespace.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\nkind: HTTPRoute\nmetadata:\n  name: foo\n  namespace: foo\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - matches:\n    - path: \/bar\n    forwardTo:\n      backend:\n      - name: bar\n        namespace: bar\n---\nkind: ReferenceGrant\nmetadata:\n  name: bar\n  namespace: bar\nspec:\n  from:\n  - group: networking.gateway.k8s.io\n    kind: HTTPRoute\n    namespace: foo\n  to:\n  - group: \u0022\u0022\n    kind: Service\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nCurrently, the Gateway API only supports HTTPRoute, and the TCPRoute, UDPRoute, TLSRoute and GRCPRoute are still in the experimental stage. The Gateway API is already supported by a large number of gateway and service mesh projects, and please [check the support status in the official Gateway documentation.](https:\/\/gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io\/implementations\/)\n\n## Ingress Gateway and Service Mesh\n\nThe service mesh focuses on east-west traffic, i.e., traffic within a Kubernetes cluster, but most service meshes, including Istio, also provide ingress gateway functionality. But, since Istio’s ingress functionality and API are more advanced than we need for this example, we’ll use [Service Mesh Interface (SMI)](https:\/\/smi-spec.io\/) to illustrate the relationship between the ingress gateway and the service mesh.\n\nSMI is a CNCF incubation project, open-sourced in 2019, that defines a common standard for vendor-independent service mesh running in Kubernetes.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the overlap between the Gateway API and the SMI.\n\n![Figure 5: Gateway API vs SMI](gateway-smi-overlay.svg)\n\nFrom the diagram, we can see a clear overlap between the Gateway API and SMI in the traffic specification section. These overlaps result in the same functionality that needs to be implemented repeatedly in both the Gateway API and the service mesh.\n\n## Traffic Management in the Istio Service Mesh\n\nOf course, not all service meshes are fully SMI-compliant. Istio, the most popular service mesh implementation, provides rich traffic management features but does not have a separate policy API for these features, instead coupling them in *VirtualService* and *DestinationRule*, as shown below.\n\n### VirtualService\n\n- Routing: canary release, matching routes based on HTTP header, URI, etc.\n- Error injection: HTTP error code injection, HTTP delay injection.\n- Traffic splitting: percentage-based traffic splitting.\n- Traffic mirroring: mirroring a certain percentage of traffic to other clusters.\n- Timeout: set the timeout period, after which the request will fail.\n- Retry: set the retry policy, such as trigger conditions, number of retries, interval time, etc.\n\n### DestinationRule\n\nLoad balancing: setting up load balancing policies, such as simple load balancing, locality-aware load balancing, and area-weighted load balancing.\nCircuit Breaking: Outlier detection and connection pool settings to remove anomalous nodes from the load balancing pool.\n\n*VirtualService* mainly handles routing-related functions, while *DestinationRule* is responsible for adding and ejecting nodes from the cluster and load balancing.\n\nGateway API Converging the Ingress Gateway from Kubernetes and Service Mesh\n\nAs mentioned above, there is a partial functional intersection between the Gateway API and the service mesh. To reduce duplication of development and enable the modeling of common concerns between the Gateway API and the service mesh, the Gateway API Working Group has proposed the [Gateway API Mesh Management and Administration](https:\/\/gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io\/contributing\/gamma\/) (GAMMA) initiative.\n\nUnder this initiative, advanced traffic management features that vary in detail across gateway implementations, such as timeouts, retries, health checks, etc., will all be implemented by individual providers through [policy attachment](https:\/\/gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io\/references\/policy-attachment\/). You can specify the resource object to which the policy attachment is attached via the *targetRef* field, as shown below.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: networking.acme.io\/v1alpha1\nkind: RetryPolicy\nmetadata:\n  name: foo\nspec:\n  override:\n    maxRetries: 10\n  default:\n    maxRetries: 5\n  targetRef:\n    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io\/v1alpha2\n    kind: HTTPRoute\n    name: foo\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nIn this example, the retry policy is attached to a resource named *foo* and *HTTPRoute*. Policy attachments are connected to different resource objects with varying priorities for effectiveness. For instance, GatewayClass is a cluster-level resource and will take precedence if the policy attachment is overlaid on it.\n\nYou can assign override and default values to additional policies whose priority in the ingress and the different resources in the mesh hierarchy are shown in the figure below.\n\n![Figure 6: Kubernetes Ingress and Mesh with Overrides and Default Priorities](policy-attachment-priority.svg)\n\nCurrently, the Gateway API is being explored to handle mesh traffic, and several [design options](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1T_DtMQoq2tccLAtJTpo3c0ohjm25vRS35MsestSL9QU\/edit#heading=h.6ks49gf06yii) have been proposed.\n\n## Envoy Gateway\n\nThe first open-source version of Envoy Gateway, [v0.2, was released](https:\/\/blog.envoyproxy.io\/introducing-envoy-gateway-ad385cc59532) in October 2022. It was created based on the Envoy proxy’s compliance with the Gateway API, of which [Tetrate ](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/)is a core sponsor. Its expressive, scalable, role-oriented API design through ingress and L4\/L7 traffic routing makes it the foundation for vendors to build value-added API gateway products.\n\nLong before Envoy Gateway was released, Envoy was massively adopted as one of the most popular cloud-native proxies, with several Gateway software builds based on Envoy, and the Istio service mesh used it as the default sidecar proxy and configured these distributed proxies via the xDS protocol. Envoy Gateway also uses xDS to configure the Envoy fleet. The following diagram illustrates the architecture of Envoy Gateway.\n\n![Figure: Envoy Gateway architecture](envoy-gateway-arch.svg)\n\nThe infrastructure provider will provide you with GatewayGlass. You can create an Envoy Gateway by creating a Gateway declaration. Your routing and policy attachments in the Gateway will be sent to the Envoy fleet via the xDS protocol.\n\nFor further information about Envoy Gateway, please read\n\n- [Hands on with the New Kubernetes Gateway API, Using Envoy Gateway 0.2](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/hands-on-with-the-gateway-api-using-envoy-gateway-0-2\/)\n- [Gateway to the Future: the New Kubernetes Gateway API and Envoy Gateway 0.2](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/gateway-to-the-future-the-new-gateway-api-and-envoy-gateway-0-2\/)\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Gateway API, as the next-generation Kubernetes Ingress API, provides a better degree of API specification for Kubernetes gateway providers as opposed to the Ingress API before, enriching the functionality of the ingress gateway while ensuring its portability and facilitating the management of gateways by different stakeholders through the separation of concerns. Finally, the GAMMA initiative is promoting the integration of the Ingress Gateway with the Gateway API for service mesh, and policy attachments may further extend the functionality of the Gateway API to east-west gateways.\n\n---\n\n*This blog was originally published at [tetrate.io](https:\/\/tetrate.io\/blog\/why-the-gateway-api-is-the-unified-future-of-ingress-for-kubernetes-and-service-mesh\/).*\n', '\/en\/blog\/why-gateway-api-is-the-future-of-ingress-and-mesh\/')">
