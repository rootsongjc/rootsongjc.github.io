              <a href="#" onclick="exportToMarkdown('In-Depth Understanding of Istio: Announcing the Publication of a New Istio Book', 'By the Cloud Native Community(China)', '\n![](book.jpg)\n\nIt\u0027s been more than 5 years since Google, IBM, and Lyft unveiled the Istio open source project in May 2017. The Istio project has developed from a seed to a tall tree in these years. Many domestic books on the Istio service mesh were launched in the two years following the release of Istio 1.0 in 2018. My country is at the forefront of the world in the field of Istio book publishing.\n\n## Service mesh: one of the core technologies of cloud native\n\nToday, Istio is nearly synonymous with service mesh in China. The development of service mesh, as one of the core cloud-native technologies described by CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation), has gone through the following stages.\n\n- 2017-2018: Exploratory Phase\n- 2019-2020: Early Adopter Phase\n- 2021 to present: Implementation on a large scale and ecological development stage\n\nCloud native technology enables enterprises to design and deploy elastically scalable applications in new dynamic settings such as public, private, and hybrid clouds, according to the CNCF. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs are examples of cloud native technology.\n\nService mesh has been included to the CNCF definition of cloud native, indicating that it is one of the representative technologies of cloud native. Google is donating Istio to CNCF today, and we have reason to expect that as a CNCF project, Istio\u0027s community will be more open, and its future development will be more smooth.\n\n## Service mesh and cloud native applications\n\nCloud-native development is gaining traction. Despite the frequent emergence of new technologies and products, service mesh has maintained its place as \u0022cloud-native network infrastructure\u0022 as part of the overall cloud-native technology stack throughout the past year. The cloud-native technology stack model is depicted in the diagram below, with representative technologies for each layer to define the standard. Service mesh and other cloud-native technologies complement each other as a new era of middleware emerges. Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime) defines the cloud-native middleware capability model, OAM defines the cloud-native application model, and so on, whereas service mesh Lattice defines a cloud-native seven-layer network model.\n\n![Cloud Native Application Model](model.jpg)\n\n## Why you need a service mesh\n\nUsing a service mesh isn\u0027t tantamount to abandoning Kubernetes; it just makes sense. The goal of Kubernetes is to manage application lifecycles through declarative configuration, whereas the goal of service mesh is to provide traffic control, security management, and observability amongst apps. How do you set up load balancing and flow management for calls between services after a robust microservice platform has been developed with Kubernetes?\n\nMany open source tools, including Istio, Linkerd, MOSN, and others, support Envoy\u0027s xDS protocol. The specification of xDS is Envoy\u0027s most significant contribution to service mesh or cloud native. Many various usage cases, such as API gateways, sidecar proxies in service meshes, and edge proxies, are derived from Envoy, which is simply a network proxy, a modern version of the proxy configured through the API.\n\nIn a nutshell, the move from Kubernetes to Istio was made for the following reasons.\n\n- Application life cycle management, specifically application deployment and management, is at the heart of Kubernetes (scaling, automatic recovery, and release).\n- Kubernetes is a microservices deployment and management platform that is scalable and extremely elastic.\n- Transparent proxy is the cornerstone of service mesh, which intercepts communication between microservices via sidecar proxy and then regulates microservice behavior via control plane settings. The deployment mode of service meshes has introduced new issues today. For service meshes, sidecar is no longer required, and an agentless service mesh based on gRPC is also being tested.\n- xDS is a protocol standard for configuring service meshes, and a gRPC-based xDS is currently being developed.\n- Kubernetes traffic management is decoupled with the service mesh. The kube-proxy component is not required to support traffic within the service mesh. The traffic between services is controlled by an abstraction close to the microservice application layer to achieve security and observability features.\n- In Kubernetes, service mesh is an upper-level abstraction of service, and Serverless is the next stage, which is why Google released Knative based on Kubernetes and Istio following Istio.\n\n## Open source in the name of the community\n\nThe ServiceMesher community was founded in May 2018 with the help of Ant Financial. Following that, a tornado of service meshes erupted in China, and the community-led translation of Istio\u0027s official documentation reached a fever pitch.\n\nI became aware of a dearth of Chinese resources for systematically teaching Istio over time, so in September 2018, I began to plan and create an Istio book, launching the Istio Handbook open source e-book project on GitHub. I met many friends who are also interested in Istio and service mesh technology in the online and offline events of the community a few months later, with the promotion of service mesh technology and the expansion of the ServiceMesher community. We unanimously agreed to collaborate on an open source Istio e-book, which will compile the community\u0027s important writings and experience into a logical text and make it available to the majority of developers.\n\nHundreds of people volunteered and began co-authoring the book in March 2019 under the auspices of the Community Stewardship Council. In May 2020, we created a cloud-native community that incorporated the original ServiceMesher community in order to further promote cloud-native technology and expand the technical knowledge supplied by the community. The scope of community operations has also widened, moving away from service mesh to more extensive cloud-native tools.\n\nThe editorial board for this book, which includes me, Ma Ruofei, Wang Baiping, Wang Wei, Luo Guangming, Zhao Huabing, Zhong Hua, and Guo Xudong, was founded in October 2020. We performed further version updates, improvements, and optimizations to this book under the supervision and assistance of the publishing business. This book, \u0022In-depth Understanding of Isito: Advanced Practice of Cloud Native Service Mesh,\u0022 finally met you after many iterations.\n\n![The book cover](cover.jpg)\n\n## About this book\n\nAfter version 1.5, Istio underwent considerable architectural modifications, and various new or better features were added, including the addition of a smart DNS proxy, additional resource objects, increased support for virtual machines, and more.\n\nThis book is based on the new edition of Istio, and it aims to provide readers with the most up-to-date and comprehensive content possible by following the newest trends in the Istio community. Furthermore, several of the book\u0027s authors are front-line development or operation and maintenance engineers with extensive Istio expertise, offering detailed and useful reference cases for the book.\n\nThis book is currently available on the [JD.com](https:\/\/item.jd.com\/13200745.html). Please read \u0022In-depth Understanding of Isito: Advanced Practice of Cloud Native Service Mesh\u0022 if you want to learn more about Istio!\n', '\/en\/blog\/istio-service-mesh-book\/')">

This blog will give you an overview of what’s new in these two releases.', '\nIstio 1.13 is the first release of 2022, and, not surprisingly, the Istio team will continue to release new versions every quarter. Overall, the new features in this release include:\n\n- Support for newer versions of Kubernetes\n- New API – ProxyConfig, for configuring sidecar proxies\n- Improved Telemetry API\n- Support for hostname-based load balancers with multiple network gateways\n\n### Support for Kubernetes Versions\n\nI often see people asking in the community which Istio supports Kubernetes versions. Istio’s website has a clear list of supported Kubernetes versions. You can see [here](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/releases\/supported-releases\/#support-status-of-istio-releases) that Istio 1.13 supports Kubernetes versions 1.20, 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23, and has been tested but not officially supported in Kubernetes 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, 1.19.\n\nWhen configuring Istio, there are a lot of checklists. I noted them all in the [Istio cheatsheet](https:\/\/github.com\/tetratelabs\/istio-cheatsheet). There are a lot of cheat sheets about configuring Istio, using resources, dealing with everyday problems, etc., in this project, which will be online soon, so stay tuned.\n\nThe following screenshot is from the Istio cheatsheet website, it shows the basic cheat sheet for setting up Istio.\n\n![Istio cheatsheet](istio-cheatsheet.jpg)\n\n### Introducing the new ProxyConfig API\n\nBefore Istio version 1.13, if you wanted to customize the configuration of the sidecar proxy, there were two ways to do it.\n\n**MeshConfig**\n\nUse MeshConfig and use IstioOperator to modify it at the Mesh level. For example, use the following configuration to alter the default discovery port for istiod.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napVersion: install.istio.io\/v1alpha1\nkind: IstioOperator\nspec:\n  meshConfig:\n\t  defaultConfig:\n      discoveryAddress: istiod:15012\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**Annotation in the Pods**\n\nYou can also use annotation at the Pod level to customize the configuration. For example, you can add the following annotations to Pod to modify the default port for \u0060istiod\u0060 of the workload:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\nanannotations:\n  proxy.istio.io\/config: |\n    discoveryAddress: istiod:15012\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nWhen you configure sidecar in either of these ways, the fields set in annotations will completely override the default fields in MeshConfig. Please refer to the [Istio documentation](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/reference\/config\/istio.mesh.v1alpha1\/#ProxyConfig) for all configuration items of ProxyConfig.\n\n**The new API – ProxyConfig**\n\nBut in 1.13, a new top-level custom resource, ProxyConfig, has been added, allowing you to customize the configuration of your sidecar proxy in one place by specifying a namespace and using a selector to select the scope of the workload, just like any other CRD. Istio currently has limited support for this API, so please refer to the [Istio documentation](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/reference\/config\/networking\/proxy-config\/) for more information on the ProxyConfig API.\n\nHowever, no matter which way you customize the configuration of the sidecar proxy, it does not take effect dynamically and requires a workload restart to take effect. For example, for the above configuration, because you changed the default port of istiod, all the workloads in the mesh need to be restarted before connecting to the control plane.\n\n### Telemetry API\n\n[MeshConfig](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/reference\/config\/istio.mesh.v1alpha1\/#MeshConfig-ExtensionProvider) customized extensions and configurations in the Istio mesh. The three pillars of observability– Metrics, Telemetry, and Logging– can each be docked to different providers. The [Telemetry API](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/tasks\/observability\/telemetry\/) gives you a one-stop place for flexible configuration of them. Like the ProxyConfig API, the Telemetry API follows the configuration hierarchy of Workload Selector \u003e Local Namespace \u003e Root Configuration Namespace. The API was introduced in Istio 1.11 and has been further refined in that release to add support for OpenTelemetry logs, filtered access logs, and custom tracing service names. See [Telemetry Configuration](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/reference\/config\/telemetry\/) for details.\n\n### Automatic resolution of multi-network gateway hostnames\n\nIn September 2021, a member of the Istio community [reported an issue](https:\/\/szabo.jp\/2021\/09\/22\/multicluster-istio-on-eks\/) with the EKS load balancer failing to resolve when running multi-cluster Istio in AWS EKS. Workloads that cross cluster boundaries need to be communicated indirectly through a dedicated east-west gateway for a multi-cluster, multi-network mesh. You can follow the instructions on [Istio’s website](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/setup\/install\/multicluster\/multi-primary_multi-network\/) to configure a multi-network, primary-remote cluster, and Istio will automatically resolve the IP address of the load balancer based on the hostname.\n\n### Istio 1.13.1 fixing the critical security vulnerabilities\n\nIstio 1.13.1 was released to fix a known [critical vulnerability](https:\/\/cve.mitre.org\/cgi-bin\/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE-2022-23635) that could lead to an unauthenticated control plane denial of service attack.\n\nThe figure below shows a multi-cluster primary-remote mesh where istiod exposes port 15012 to the public Internet via a gateway so that a pod on another network can connect to it.\n\n![Multi-network Mesh](multi-network-mesh.jpg)\n\nWhen installing a multi-network, primary-remote mode Istio mesh, for a remote Kubernetes cluster to access the control plane, an east-west Gateway needs to be installed in the Primary cluster, exposing port 15012 of the control plane istiod to the Internet. An attacker could send specially crafted messages to that port, causing the control plane to crash. If you set up a firewall to allow traffic from only some IPs to access this port, you will be able to reduce the impact of the problem. It is recommended that you upgrade to Istio 1.13.1 immediately to resolve the issue completely.\n\n### IstioCon 2022\n\n![IstioCon 2022](istiocon-2022.jpg)\n\nFinally, as a committee member for the last and current IstioCon, I call on everyone to register for [IstioCon 2022](https:\/\/events.istio.io\/istiocon-2022\/), which will be held online on April 25! It will be an industry-focused event, a platform to connect contributors and users to discuss the uses of Istio in different architectural setups, its limitations, and where to take the project next. The main focus on end-user companies, as we look forward to sharing a diversity of case studies showing how to use Istio in production.\n', '\/en\/blog\/what-is-new-in-istio-1-13\/')">

I have worked on service mesh with the community for 4 years now, and will summarize the development of service mesh in 2021 from this perspective. Since Istio is the most popular service mesh, this article will focus on the technical and ecological aspects of Istio.\n\n## Service mesh: a critical tech for Cloud Native Infrastructure \n\nAs one of the vital technologies [defined by CNCF](https:\/\/github.com\/cncf\/toc\/blob\/main\/DEFINITION.md) for cloud native, Istio has been around for five years now. Their development has gone through the following periods.\n\n- Exploration phase: 2017-2018\n- Early adopter phase: 2019-2020\n- Large-scale landing and ecological development phase: 2021-present\n\nService mesh has crossed the “chasm”(refer [Crossing the Chasm](https:\/\/thinkinsights.net\/strategy\/crossing-the-chasm\/) theory) and is in between the “early majority” and “late majority” phases of adoption. Based on feedback from the audience of [Istio Weekly,](https:\/\/github.com\/tetratelabs\/istio-weekly\/) users are no longer blindly following new technologies for experimentation and are starting to consider whether they need them in their organization dialectically.\n\n![Cross the chasm](008i3skNly1gysddnj9i2j30sg0fqaaz.jpg)\n\nWhile new technologies and products continue to emerge, the service mesh, as part of the cloud native technology stack, has continued to solidify its position as the “cloud native network infrastructure” over the past year. The diagram below illustrates the cloud native technology stack model, where each layer has several representative technologies that define the standard. As new-age middleware, the service mesh mirrors other cloud native technologies, such as [Dapr](https:\/\/dapr.io\/) (Distributed Application Runtime), which represents the capability model for cloud native middleware, [OAM](https:\/\/oam.dev\/), which defines the cloud native application model, and the service mesh, which defines the L7 network model.\n\n![Cloud Native Stack](008i3skNly1gysddogtenj30sg0qlwgs.jpg)\n\nA layered view of the cloud native application platform technology stack\n\n## Optimizing the mesh for large scale production applications with different deployment models\n\nOver the past year, the community focused on the following areas.\n\n- Performance optimization: performance issues of service mesh in large-scale application scenarios.\n- Protocol and extensions: enabling service mesh to support arbitrary L7 network protocols.\n- Deployment models: Proxyless vs. Node model vs. Sidecar model.\n- eBPF: putting some of the service mesh’s capabilities to the kernel layer.\n\n### Performance optimization\n\nIstio was designed to serve service to service traffic by “proto-protocol forwarding”. The goal is making the service mesh as “transparent” as possible to applications. Thus using IPtables to hijack the traffic, according to the community-provided test results Istio 1.2 adds only 3 ms to the baseline latency for a mesh with 1000 RPS on 16 connections. However, because of issues inherent in the IPtables conntrack module, Istio’s performance issues begin to emerge as the mesh size increases. To optimize the performance of the Istio sidecar for resource usage and network latency, the community gave the following solutions.\n\n- Sidecar configuration: By configuring service dependencies manually or by adding an Operator to the control plane, the number of service configurations sent to Sidecar can be reduced, thus reducing the resource footprint of the data plane; for more automatic and intelligent configuration of Sidecar, the open source projects [Slime](https:\/\/github.com\/slime-io\/slime) and [Aeraki](https:\/\/github.com\/aeraki-framework\/aeraki) both offer their innovative configuration loading solutions.\n- The introduction of eBPF: eBPF can be a viable solution to optimize the performance of the service mesh. Some Cilium-based startups even radically propose to use eBPF to replace the Sidecar proxy completely. Still, the Envoy proxy\/xDS protocol has become the proxy for the service mesh implementation and supports the Layer 7 protocol very well. We can use eBPF to improve network performance, but complex protocol negotiation, parsing, and user scaling remain challenging to implement on the user side.\n\n### Protocol and extensions\n\nExtensibility of Istio has always been a significant problem, and there are two aspects to Istio’s extensibility.\n\n- Protocol level: allowing Istio to support all L7 protocols\n- Ecological: allowing Istio to run more extensions\n\nIstio uses Envoy as its data plane. Extending Istio is essentially an extension of Envoy’s functionality. Istio’s official solution is to use WebAssembly, and in Istio 1.12, the [Wasm plugin configuration API](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/blog\/istio-wasm-extensions-and-ecosystem\/) was introduced to extend the Istio ecosystem. Istio’s extension mechanism uses the [Proxy-Wasm Application Binary Interface (ABI)](https:\/\/github.com\/proxy-wasm\/spec) specification to provide a set of proxy-independent streaming APIs and utilities that can be implemented in any language with an appropriate SDK. Today, Proxy-Wasm’s SDKs are AssemblyScript (similar to TypeScript), C\u002b\u002b, Rust, Zig, and Go (using the TinyGo WebAssembly System Interface).\n\nThere are still relatively few WebAssembly extensions available, and many enterprises choose to customize their CRD and build a service mesh management plane based on Istio. In addition, making Istio support heterogeneous environments for all workloads, such as virtual machines and containers, is also in strong demand for end-users. It allows them to migrate applications from traditional loads to service mesh easily. Finally, there is the hybrid cloud traffic management with multiple clusters and mesh, which is a more advanced requirement.\n\n### Deployment models\n\nWhen the service mesh concept first emerged, there was a debate between the Per-node and Sidecar models, represented by Linkerd and Istio. eBPF later proposed a kernel to sink the service mesh, which led to more service mesh deployment models, as shown in the figure below.\n\n![Service Mesh Deployment Models](008i3skNly1gysddpco2mj30qz0sgwhk.jpg)\n\nThese four deployment methods have their own advantages and disadvantages, the specific choice of which depends on the actual situation.\n\n### Development of the Istio ecosystem and the projects that support Istio\n\n2021 was also an exciting year for the Istio community, with a series of events and tutorials.\n\n- February, the first Istio distribution, [Tetrate Istio Distro (TID)](https:\/\/istio.tetratelabs.io\/).\n- February, the first [IstioCon](https:\/\/events.istio.io\/istiocon-2021\/) was held online, with over 2,000 participants.\n- March, the first free online [Istio Fundamentals Course](https:\/\/academy.tetrate.io\/courses\/istio-fundamentals) is released.\n- May, the first [Certification Istio Administrator exam](https:\/\/academy.tetrate.io\/courses\/certified-istio-administrator) be released.\n- May, ServiceMeshCon Europe was held online.\n- July, [Istio Meetup China](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/zh\/blog\/2021\/istiomeetups-china\/) was held in Beijing with more than 100 attendees.\n- October, ServiceMeshCon North America was held in Los Angeles.\n\nThere are also numerous open source projects related to Istio Service Mesh, as shown in the table below.\n\n| **Project**                                                  | **Value**

experimenting, users in 2021 looked for more practical uses for service mesh before implementing them. Their position as the infrastructure of cloud native networks is further strengthened, and more importantly, the service mesh ecosystem is emerging. Looking ahead, in 2022, two technologies to watch are eBPF and WebAssembly(Wasm). We believe that more good examples of service mesh practices will emerge, taking the ecology and standardization a step further.\n', '\/en\/blog\/service-mesh-in-2021\/')">

Based on the Kubernetes Operator implementation, Slime can be used as a CRD manager that seamlessly interfaces with Istio without needing any customization or definition of dynamic service governance policies. This achieves automatic and convenient use of Istio and Envoy’s advanced features.\n\nSlime addresses the following issues:\n\n- Implementing higher-level extensions in Istio. For example, extending the HTTP plugin; adaptive traffic limiting based on the resource usage of the service.\n- Poor performance arising from Istio sending all the configurations within the mesh to each sidecar proxy.\n\nSlime solves these problems by building an Istio management plane. Its main purpose are\n\n- to build a pluggable controller to facilitate the extension of new functions.\n- to obtain data by listening to the data plane to intelligently generate the configuration for Istio.\n- to build a higher-level CRD for the user to configure, which Slime converts into an Istio configuration.\n\nThe following diagram shows the flow chart of Istio as an Istio management plane.\n\n![Slime architecture](slime-arch.png)\n\nThe specific steps for Slime to manage Istio are as follows.\n\n1. Slime operator completes the initialization of Slime components in Kubernetes based on the administrator’s configuration.\n2. Developers create configurations that conform to the Slime CRD specification and apply them to Kubernetes clusters.\n3. Slime queries the monitoring data of the relevant service stored in Prometheus and converts the Slime CRD into an Istio CRD, in conjunction with the configuration of the adaptive part of the Slime CRD while pushing it to the Global Proxy.\n4. Istio listens for the creation of Istio CRDs.\n5. Istio pushes the configuration information of the Sidecar Proxy to the corresponding Sidecar Proxy in the data plane.\n\nThe diagram below shows the internal architecture of Slime.\n\n![Slime Internal](slime-internal.png)\n\nWe can divide Slime internally into three main components.\n\n- **slime-boot**: operator for deploying Slime modules on Kubernetes.\n- **slime-controller**: the core component of Slime that listens to the Slime CRD and converts it to an Istio CRD.\n- **slime-metric**: the component used to obtain service metrics information. slime-controller dynamically adjusts service governance rules based on the information it receives.\n\nThe following diagram shows the architecture of Slime Adaptive Traffic Limiting.\n![Slime smart limiter](slime-smart-filter.png)\n\nSlime dynamically configures traffic limits by interfacing with the Prometheus metric server to obtain real-time monitoring.\n\nSlime’s adaptive traffic limitation process has two parts: one that converts SmartLimiter to[ EnvoyFilter](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/reference\/config\/networking\/envoy-filter\/) and the other that monitors the data. Slime also provides an external monitoring data interface (Metric Discovery Server) that allows you to sync custom monitoring metrics to the traffic limiting component via MDS.\n\nThe CRD SmartLimiter created by Slime is used to configure adaptive traffic limiting. Its configuration is close to natural semantics, e.g., if you want to trigger an access limit for Service A with a limit of 30QPS when the CPU exceeds 80%, the corresponding SmartLimiter is defined as follows.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: microservice.netease.com\/v1alpha1\nkind: SmartLimiter\nmetadata:\n  name: a\n  namespace: default\nspec:\n  descriptors:\n  -  action:\n       fill_interval:\n         seconds: 1\n         quota: \u002230\/{pod}\u0022 # 30 is the quota for this service. If there are three pods, the limit is 10 per pod.\n       condition: \u0022{cpu}\u003e0.8\u0022 # Auto-fill the template based on the value of the monitor {cpu}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n### **Aeraki: A Non-Invasive Istio Extension Toolset**\n\n[Aeraki](https:\/\/github.com\/aeraki-framework\/aeraki) is a service mesh project open sourced by Tencent Cloud in March 2021. Aeraki provides an end-to-end cloud-native service mesh protocol extension solution that provides Istio with powerful third-party protocol extension capabilities in a non-intrusive way, supporting traffic management for Dubbo, Thrift, Redis, and private protocols in Istio. Aeraki’s architecture is shown in the following diagram.\n\n![Aeraki architecture](aeraki-architecture.png)\n\nAeraki architecture, source [Istio blog](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2021\/aeraki\/).\n\nAs seen in the Aeraki architecture diagram, the Aeraki protocol extension solution consists of two components.\n\n- **Aeraki**: Aeraki runs as an Istio enhancement component on the control plane, providing user-friendly traffic rule configurations to operations via CRDs. Aeraki translates these traffic rule configurations into Envoy configurations distributed via Istio to sidecar proxies on the data plane. Aeraki also acts as an RDS server providing dynamic routing to the MetaProtocol Proxy on the data plane. The RDS provided by Aeraki differs from Envoy’s RDS in that Envoy RDS primarily offers dynamic routing for the HTTP protocol, while Aeraki RDS is designed to provide dynamic routing capabilities for all L7 protocols developed on the MetaProtocol framework.\n- **MetaProtocol Proxy**: A generic L7 protocol proxy based on Envoy implementation. MetaProtocol Proxy is an extension of Envoy. It unifies the basic capabilities of service discovery, load balancing, RDS dynamic routing, traffic mirroring, fault injection, local\/global traffic limiting, etc. for L7 protocols, which greatly reduces the difficulty of developing third-party protocols on Envoy and allows you to quickly create a third-party protocol plug-in based on MetaProtocol by only implementing the codec interface.\n\nBefore the introduction of MetaProtocol Proxy, if you wanted to use Envoy to implement an L7 protocol to implement routing, traffic limiting, telemetry, etc., you needed to write a complete TCP filter, which would have required a lot of work. For most L7 protocols, the required traffic management capabilities are similar, so there is no need to duplicate this work in each L7 filter implementation. The Aeraki project uses a MetaProtocol Proxy to implement these unified capabilities, as shown in the following figure.\n\n![MetaProtocol proxy](metaprotocol-proxy.png)\n\nMetaProtocol proxy, source [Istio blog](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2021\/aeraki\/).\n\nBased on MetaProtocol Proxy, we only need to implement the codec interface part of the code to write a new L7 protocol Envoy Filter. In addition, without adding a single line of code, Aeraki can provide configuration distribution and RDS dynamic routing configuration for this L7 protocol at the control plane.\n\n### **Make Istio work for all environments and workloads**\n\nWe have seen that NetEase and Tencent are scaling Istio mainly by building Operator. However, this scaling is not enough for multi-cluster management. We know that much of our current infrastructure is transitioning to cloud native or containerized, which means containers, virtual machines, and other environments co-exist. How do we unify traffic management of these different environments? It is possible to do so using Istio.\n\nYou have to again build a management plane on top of Istio and add an abstraction layer to add CRDs that apply to cluster management, such as cluster traffic configuration, policy configuration, etc. Additionally, you have to deploy a Gateway in each cluster that connects uniformly to an edge proxy that interconnects all the groups. \n\nTo learn more about Tetrate Service Bridge (TSB), which provides this layer of infrastructure, you can go [here](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/tetrate-service-bridge\/). TSB is built on the open source Istio with enhancements, it follows the concept of the above two open source projects, and also builds a management plane to support heterogeneous environments.\n\nAs we can see, the Istio-based projects and the open source environment are booming and companies like Tetrate are doing useful jobs of productizing and making Istio available to all workloads.\n\n', '\/en\/blog\/istio-extensions-slime-and-aeraki\/')">

In my [last blog](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/blog\/why-is-service-mesh-a-necessary-part-of-cloud-native\/), I talked about how service mesh is an integral part of cloud native applications. However, building infrastructure can be a big deal. There is no shortage of debate in the community about the practicability of service mesh and Istio– here’s a list of common questions and concerns, and how to address them.\n\n- Is anyone using Istio in production?\n- What is the impact on application performance due to the many resources consumed by injecting sidecar into the pod?\n- Istio supports a limited number of protocols; is it scalable?\n- Will Istio be manageable? – Or is it too complex, old services too costly to migrate, and the learning curve too steep?\n\nI will answer each of these questions below.\n\n### Istio is architecturally stable, production-ready, and ecologically emerging\n\n[Istio 1.12](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/blog\/istio-wasm-extensions-and-ecosystem\/) was just released in November – and has evolved significantly since the explosion of service mesh in 2018 (the year Istio co-founders established Tetrate). Istio has a large community of providers and [users](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/about\/case-studies\/). The Istio SIG of Cloud Native Community has held eight Istio Big Talk (Istio 大咖说), with Baidu, Tencent, NetEase, Xiaohongshu(小红书), and Xiaodian Technology(小电科技) sharing their Istio practices. According to [CNCF Survey Report 2020](https:\/\/www.cncf.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/CNCF_Survey_Report_2020.pdf), about 50% of the companies surveyed are using a service mesh in production or planning to in the next year, and about half (47%) of organizations using a service mesh in production are using Istio.\n\nMany companies have developed extensions or plugins for Istio, such as Ant, NetEase, eBay, and Airbnb. Istio’s architecture has been stable since the 1.5 release, and the release cycle is fixed quarterly, with the current project’s main task being Day-2 Operations. \n\nThe Istio community has also hosted various events, with the first IstioCon in March 2021, the Istio Meetup China in Beijing in July, and the Service Mesh Summit 2022 in Shanghai in January 2022.\n\nSo we can say that the Istio architecture is stable and production-ready, and the ecosystem is budding.\n\n### The impact of service mesh on application performance\n\nA service mesh uses iptables to do traffic hijacking by default to be transparent to applications. When the number of services is large, there are a lot of iptables rules that affect network performance. You can use techniques like [eBPF](https:\/\/cloudnative.to\/blog\/how-ebpf-streamlines-the-service-mesh\/) to provide application performance, but the method requires a high version of the operating system kernel, which few enterprises can achieve.\n\n![Istio DNS](008i3skNly1gxgyfcfm5oj30sg0djmxt.jpg)\n\nIn the early days, Istio distributed the routing information of all services in the mesh to all proxy sidecars, which caused [sidecar](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/reference\/config\/networking\/sidecar\/)s to take up a lot of resources. [Aeraki](https:\/\/github.com\/aeraki-framework\/aeraki) and [Slime](https:\/\/github.com\/slime-io\/slime) can achieve configuration lazy loading. We will introduce these two open-source projects in the Istio open-source ecosystem.\n\nFinally, there is a problem related to Sidecar proxy operation and maintenance: upgrading all Envoy proxies while ensuring constant traffic. A solution is using the [SidecarSet](https:\/\/xie.infoq.cn\/article\/23ae6d3f0d0260b4797a708a0) resource in the open-source project [OpenKruise](https:\/\/github.com\/openkruise\/kruise).\n\nThe resource consumption and network latency associated with the introduction of Sidecar are also within reasonable limits, as you can see from the [service mesh benchmark performance tests](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2019\/performance-best-practices\/).\n\n### Extending the Istio service mesh\n\nThe next question is about extending the Istio service mesh. The current solution given by the Istio community is to use [WebAssembly](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/blog\/istio-wasm-extensions-and-ecosystem\/), an extension that is still relatively little used in production by now and has performance concerns. Most of the answers I’ve observed are CRDs that build a service mesh management plane based on Istio.\n\nAlso, making Istio support heterogeneous environments for all workloads, such as virtual machines and containers, is in strong demand for end-users. It allows them to migrate applications from traditional loads to cloud native easily. Finally, hybrid cloud traffic management for multiple clusters and meshes is a more advanced requirement.\n\n### Steep learning curve\n\nMany people complain that Istio has too little learning material. Istio has been open source for four years, and there are a lot of learning resources now:\n\n- [Istio Documentation](https:\/\/istio.io\/)\n- [IstioCon 2021](https:\/\/events.istio.io\/istiocon-2021\/)\n- [Istio Big Talk\/Istio Weekly](https:\/\/github.com\/tetratelabs\/istio-weekly)\n- [Istio Fundamentals Course](https:\/\/academy.tetrate.io\/courses\/istio-fundamentals)\n- [Certified Istio Administrator](https:\/\/academy.tetrate.io\/courses\/certified-istio-administrator)\n\nYes, Istio is complex, but it’s been getting more and more manageable with every release. In my next blog, I will introduce you to two open source projects that extend Istio and give you some insight into what’s going on in the Istio community.\n', '\/en\/blog\/the-debate-in-the-community-about-istio-and-service-mesh\/')">

              <a href="#" onclick="exportToMarkdown('Service Mesh - An Integral Part of Cloud-Native Applications', 'This article will explore the relationship between service mesh and cloud native.', '\nIf you don’t know what Istio is, you can read my previous articles below:\n\n- [What Is Istio and Why Does Kubernetes Need it?](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/blog\/what-is-istio-and-why-does-kubernetes-need-it\/)\n- [Why do you need Istio when you already have Kubernetes?](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/blog\/why-do-you-need-istio-when-you-already-have-kubernetes\/)\n\nThis article will explore the relationship between service mesh and cloud native.\n\n### Service mesh – the product of the container orchestration war\n\nIf you’ve been following the cloud-native space since its early days, you’ll remember the container orchestration wars of 2015 to 2017. Kubernetes won the container wars in 2017, the idea of microservices had taken hold, and the trend toward containerization was unstoppable. Kubernetes architecture matured and slowly became boring, and service mesh technologies, represented by Linkerd and Istio, entered the CNCF-defined cloud-native critical technologies on the horizon.\n\nKubernetes was designed with the concept of cloud-native in mind. A critical idea in cloud-native is the architectural design of microservices. When a single application is split into microservices, how can microservices be managed to ensure the SLA of the service as the number of services increases? The service mesh was born to solve this problem at the architectural level, free programmers’ creativity, and avoid tedious service discovery, monitoring, distributed tracing, and other matters.\n\nThe service mesh takes the standard functionality of microservices down to the infrastructure layer, allowing developers to focus more on business logic and thus speed up service delivery, which is consistent with the whole idea of cloud-native. You no longer need to integrate bulky SDKs in your application, develop and maintain SDKs for different languages, and just use the service mesh for Day 2 operations after the application is deployed.\n\nThe service mesh is regarded as the next generation of microservices. In the diagram, we can see that many of the concerns of microservices overlap with the functionality of Kubernetes. Kubernetes focuses on the application lifecycle, managing resources and deployments with little control over services. The service mesh fills this gap. The service mesh can connect, control, observe and protect microservices.\n\n### **Kubernetes vs. xDS vs. Istio**\n\nThis diagram shows the layered architecture of Kubernetes and Istio.\n\n![Kubernetes vs xDS vs Istio](008i3skNly1gxgxss9mamj30n90d73zs.jpg)\n\nThe diagram indicates that the kube-proxy settings are global and cannot be controlled at a granular level for each service. All Kubernetes can do is topology-aware routing, routing traffic closer to the Pod, and setting network policies in and out of the Pod.\n\nIn contrast, the service mesh takes traffic control out of the service layer in Kubernetes through sidecar proxies, injects proxies into each Pod, and manipulates these distributed proxies through a control plane. It allows for more excellent resiliency.\n\nKube-proxy implements traffic load balancing between multiple pod instances of a Kubernetes service. But how do you finely control the traffic between these services — such as dividing the traffic by percentage to different application versions (which are all part of the same service, but on other deployments), or doing canary releases and blue-green releases?\n\nThe Kubernetes community gives a way to do canary releases using Deployment, assigning different pods to deployed services by modifying the pod’s label.\n\n![Envoy Architecture](008i3skNly1gxgxsswmoij30sg0kl76r.jpg)\n\nCurrently, the most popular open-source implementation of service mesh in the world is Istio. From the [CNCF Survey Report 2020](https:\/\/www.cncf.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/CNCF_Survey_Report_2020.pdf), we know that Istio is the most used service mesh in production today. Many companies have built their service mesh based on Istio, such as Ant, Airbnb, eBay, NetEase, Tencent, etc.\n\n![CNCF Survey Report 2020](008i3skNly1gxgxstgg4qj30sg0gg0ts.jpg)\n\nFigure from [CNCF Survey Report 2020](https:\/\/www.cncf.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/CNCF_Survey_Report_2020.pdf)\n\nIstio is developed based on Envoy, which has been used by default as its distributed proxy since the first day it was open-sourced. Envoy pioneered the creation of the xDS protocol for distributed gateway configuration, greatly simplifying the configuration of large-scale distributed networks. Ant Group open source MOSN also supported xDS In 2019. Envoy was also one of the first projects to graduate from CNCF, tested by large-scale production applications.\n\n### Service mesh – the cloud-native networking infrastructure\n\nWith the above comparison between Kubernetes and service mesh in mind, we can see the place of service mesh in the cloud-native application architecture. That is, building a cloud-native network infrastructure specifically provides:\n\n- Traffic management: controlling the flow of traffic and API calls between services, making calls more reliable, and enhancing network robustness in different environments.\n- Observability: understanding the dependencies between services and the nature and flow of traffic between them provides the ability to identify problems quickly.\n- Policy enforcement: controlling access policies between services by configuring the mesh rather than by changing the code.\n- Service Identification and Security: providing service identifiability and security protection in the mesh.\n', '\/en\/blog\/service-mesh-an-integral-part-of-cloud-native-apps\/')">

What are the ways to expose the services in the Istio mesh? This article gives you the answer.', '\nAPI gateways have been around for a long time as the entry point for clients to access the back-end, mainly to manage “north-south” traffic, In recent years, service mesh architectures have become popular, mainly for managing internal systems,(i.e. “east-west” traffic), while a service mesh like Istio also has built-in gateways that bring traffic inside and outside the system under unified control. This often creates confusion for first-time users of Istio. What is the relationship between the service mesh and the API gateway? How does Istio’s gateway work? What are the ways to expose the services in the Istio mesh? This article gives you the answer.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n- The service mesh was originally created to solve the problem of managing internal traffic for distributed systems, but API gateways existed long before it.\n- While the Gateway is built into Istio, you can still use a custom Ingress Controller to proxy external traffic.\n- API gateways and service mesh are converging.\n\n## How do I expose services in the Istio mesh?\n\nThe following diagram shows four approaches to expose services in the Istio mesh using Istio Gateway, Kubernetes Ingress, API Gateway, and NodePort\/LB.\n\n![Exposing services through Istio Ingress Gateway](access-cluster.svg)\n\nThe Istio mesh is shaded, and the traffic in the mesh is internal (east-west) traffic, while the traffic from clients accessing services within the Kubernetes cluster is external (north-south) traffic. \n\n| **Approach**          | **Controller**     | **Features**                                                 |\n| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| NodePort\/LoadBalancer | Kubernetes         | Load balancing                                               |\n| Kubernetes Ingress    | Ingress controller | Load balancing, TLS, virtual host, traffic routing           |\n| Istio Gateway         | Istio              | Load balancing, TLS, virtual host, advanced traffic routing, other advanced Istio features |\n| API Gateway           | API Gateway        | Load balancing, TLS, virtual host, advanced traffic routing, API lifecycle management, billing, rate limiting, policy enforcement, data aggregation |\n\nSince NodePort\/LoadBalancer is a basic way to expose services built into Kubernetes, this article will not discuss that option. Each of the other three approaches will be described below.\n\n## Using Kubernetes Ingress to expose traffic\n\nWe all know that clients of a Kubernetes cluster cannot directly access the IP address of a pod because the pod is in a network plane built into Kubernetes. We can expose services inside Kubernetes outside the cluster using NodePort or Load Balancer Kubernetes service type. To support virtual hosting, hiding and saving IP addresses, you can use Ingress resources to expose services in Kubernetes.\n\n![Kubernetes Ingress to expose services](ingress.svg)\n\nIngress is a Kubernetes resource that controls the behavior of an ingress controller that does the traffic touring, which is the equivalent of a load-balanced directional proxy server such as Nginx, Apache, etc., which also includes rule definitions, i.e., routing information for URLs, which is provided by the [Ingress controller](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/concepts\/services-networking\/ingress\/#ingress-controllers).\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io\/v1beta1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io\/ingress.class: istio\n  name: ingress\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - host: httpbin.example.com\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: \/status\/*\n        backend:\n          serviceName: httpbin\n          servicePort: 8000\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThe *kubernetes.io\/ingress.class: istio* annotation in the example above indicates that the Ingress uses the Istio Ingress Controller which in fact uses Envoy proxy. \n\n## Using Istio Gateway to expose services\n\nIstio is a popular service mesh implementation that has evolved from Kubernetes that implements some features that Kubernetes doesn’t. (See [What is Istio and why does Kubernetes need Istio?](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/blog\/what-is-istio-and-why-does-kubernetes-need-it\/)) It makes traffic management transparent to the application, moving this functionality from the application to the platform layer and becoming a cloud-native infrastructure.\n\nIstio used Kubernetes Ingress as the traffic portal in versions prior to Istio 0.8, where Envoy was used as the Ingress Controller. From Istio 0.8 and later, Istio created the Gateway object. Gateway and VirtualService are used to represent the configuration model of Istio Ingress, and the default implementation of Istio Ingress uses the same Envoy proxy. In this way, the Istio control plane controls both the ingress gateway and the internal sidecar proxy with a consistent configuration model. These configurations include routing rules, policy enforcement, telemetry, and other service control functions.\n\nThe Istio Gateway resources function similarly to the Kubernetes Ingress in that it is responsible for north-south traffic to and from the cluster. The Istio Gateway acts as a load balancer to carry connections to and from the edge of the service mesh. The specification describes a set of open ports and the protocols used by those ports, as well as the SNI configuration for load balancing, etc.\n\nThe Istio Gateway resource itself can only be configured for L4 through L6, such as exposed ports, TLS settings, etc.; however, the Gateway can be bound to a VirtualService, where routing rules can be configured on L7, such as versioned traffic routing, fault injection, HTTP redirects, HTTP rewrites, and all other routing rules supported within the mesh.\n\nBelow is an example of a Gateway binding to a VirtualService. The pod with the “istio: ingressgateway” label will act as the Ingress controller and route HTTP traffic to port 80 of the httpbin.example.com virtual host. The biggest difference between this and using Kubernetes Ingress is that it requires us to manually bind the VirtualService to the Gateway and specify the pod where the Gateway is located. This configuration is equivalent to opening up an entry point to Kubernetes for external access.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: networking.istio.io\/v1alpha3\nkind: Gateway\nmetadata:\n  name: httpbin-gateway\nspec:\n  selector:\n    istio: ingressgateway\n  servers:\n  - port:\n      number: 80\n      name: http\n      protocol: HTTP\n    hosts:\n    - \u0022httpbin.example.com\u0022\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThe VirtualService below is bound to the gateway above via *gateways* to accept traffic from that gateway.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\napiVersion: networking.istio.io\/v1alpha3\nkind: VirtualService\nmetadata:\n  name: httpbin\nspec:\n  hosts:\n  - \u0022httpbin.example.com\u0022\n  gateways:\n  - httpbin-gateway\n  http:\n  - match:\n    - uri:\n        prefix: \/status\n    route:\n    - destination:\n        port:\n          number: 8000\n        host: httpbin\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## Using an API Gateway\n\nAPI gateways are API management tools that sit between the client and the back-end service and are widely used in microservices as a way to separate the client interface from the back-end implementation. When a client makes a request, the API gateway breaks it down into multiple requests, then routes them to the correct location, generates a response, and keeps track of everything. \n\nThe API Gateway is a special type of service in the microservices architecture that serves as the entry point for all microservices and is responsible for performing routing requests, protocol conversions, aggregating data, authentication, rate limiting, circuit breaking, and more. Most enterprise APIs are deployed through API Gateways, which typically handle common tasks across API service systems, such as TLS termination, authentication and authorization, rate limiting, and statistical information.\n\nThere can be one or more API Gateways in the mesh. The responsibilities of the API Gateway are\n\n- Request routing and version control\n- Facilitating the transition of monolithic applications to microservices\n- Permission authentication\n- Data aggregation: monitoring and billing\n- Protocol conversion\n- Messaging and caching\n- Security and alerting\n\nMany of the above basic functions such as routing and permission authentication can also be achieved through Istio Gateway, but some mature API gateways may be more advantageous in terms of feature richness and scalability.\n\n- The introduction of API Gateway requires consideration of the deployment, operation and maintenance, load balancing, and other scenarios of API Gateway itself, which increases the complexity of back-end services.\n- An API Gateway carries a large number of interface adaptations, which makes it difficult to maintain.\n- For some scenarios, the addition of a hop may lead to a reduction in performance.\n\nCurrently, some API Gateway imitations are building their own service mesh by deploying them in the sidecar.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn the Istio mesh, you can use a variety of Kubernetes Ingress Controllers to act as entry gateways, but of course, you can also use Istio’s built-in Istio Gateway directly, for policy control, traffic management, and usage monitoring. The advantage of this is that the gateway can be managed directly through Istio’s control plane, without the need for additional tools. But for functions such as API statement cycle management, complex billing, protocol conversion, and authentication, a traditional API gateway may be a better fit for you. So, you can choose according to your needs, or you can use a combination.\n\nSome traditional reverse proxies are also moving towards Service Mesh, such as Nginx with Nginx Service Mesh and Traefik with Traefik Mesh, and some API gateway products are also moving towards Service Mesh, such as Kong with Kuma, and in the future, we will see more convergence of API gateways, reverse proxies, and service meshes.\n', '\/en\/blog\/istio-servicemesh-api-gateway\/')">

Do your virtual machines and services in a Kubernetes cluster need to interact? This article will take you through the process and considerations of building a hybrid cloud using Kubernetes and an Istio Service Mesh. Together, Kubernetes and Istio can be used to bring hybrid workloads into a mesh and achieve interoperability for multicluster. But another layer of infrastructure — a management plane — is helpful for managing multicluster or multimesh deployments.\n\n## Kubernetes\n\nUsing Kubernetes enables rapid deployment of a distributed environment that enables cloud interoperability and unifies the control plane on the cloud. It also provides resource objects, such as Service, Ingress and [Gateway](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/blog\/2021\/04\/22\/evolving-kubernetes-networking-with-the-gateway-api\/), to handle application traffic. The Kubernetes API Server communicates with the kube-proxy component on each node in the cluster, creates iptables rules for the node, and forwards requests to other pods.\n\nAssuming that a client now wants to access a service in Kubernetes, the request is first sent to the Ingress\/Gateway, then forwarded to the backend service (Service A in the diagram below) based on the routing configuration in the Ingress\/Gateway. Then Service A polls an instance of Service B for the traffic requested by Service B. Lastly, the traffic requested by Service A for Service B is polled forward to Service B’s instance.\n\n![Kubernetes](008i3skNly1gsgg6a11l1j31lu0u042s.jpg)\n\n## Kubernetes Multicluster\n\nThe most common usage scenarios for multicluster management include:\n\n- service traffic load balancing\n- isolating development and production environments\n- decoupling data processing and data storage\n- cross-cloud backup and disaster recovery\n- flexible allocation of compute resources\n- low-latency access to services across regions\n- avoiding vendor lock-in\n\nThere are often multiple Kubernetes clusters within an enterprise; and the [KubeFed](https:\/\/github.com\/kubernetes-sigs\/kubefed) implementation of Kubernetes cluster federation developed by [Multicluster SIG](https:\/\/github.com\/kubernetes\/community\/blob\/master\/sig-multicluster\/README.md) enables multicluster management capabilities, which allows all Kubernetes clusters to be managed through the same interface.\n\nThere are several general issues that need to be addressed when using cluster federation:\n\n- Configuring which clusters need to be federated\n- API resources need to be propagated across the clusters\n- Configuring how API resources are distributed to different clusters\n- Registering DNS records in clusters to enable service discovery across clusters\n\nThe following is a multicluster architecture for [KubeSphere](https:\/\/kubesphere.io\/) — one of the most commonly used Kubernetes multicluster management architectures — where the Host Cluster serves as the control plane with two member clusters, West and East.\n\n![Multicluster](008i3skNly1gsgg7a2ojvj31aa0u0491.jpg)\n\nThe Host Cluster needs to be able to access the API Server of the Member Cluster, but the network connectivity between Member Clusters is not required. The Host Cluster is independent of the Member Cluster it manages and the Member Cluster is not aware of the existence of the Host Cluster. The advantage of this is that when the control plane fails, the Member Cluster will not be affected and the deployed load can still operate normally without being affected.\n\nThe Host Cluster also assumes the role of API portal, and the Host Cluster forwards the resource requests to the Member Cluster — which is convenient for aggregation and also facilitates unified authority authentication. We see that there is a Federation Control Plane in the Host Cluster, where the Push Reconciler propagates the identity, role, and role binding from the Federation Cluster to all Member Clusters.\n\n## Istio Service Mesh\n\nConsider using the Istio service mesh when we have multilingual, multiversion microservices running in Kubernetes and need finer-grained canary publishing and unified security policy management for inter-service observability. Istio enables intelligent application-aware load balancing from the application layer to other Service Mesh-enabled services in the cluster, by transparently intercepting all traffic to and from the application using IPTables, and bypassing the primary kube-proxy load balancing. The Istio control plane communicates with the Kubernetes API Server to obtain information about all registered services in the cluster.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the basics of Istio, where all nodes belong to the same Kubernetes cluster.\n\n![Istio Service Mesh](008i3skNly1gsgg6sdrk2j32v60u0qbb.jpg)\n\nYou may end up with at least a few Kubernetes clusters, each hosting microservices. Multiple [deployment models](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/setup\/install\/multicluster\/) exist for Istio’s multicluster deployments — depending on network isolation, primary and backup — which can be specified by declaration when deploying using Istio Operator. Communication between these microservices in a cluster can be enhanced by a service mesh. Within the cluster, Istio provides common communication patterns to improve resiliency, security and observability.\n\nAll of the above is about application load management on Kubernetes, but for legacy applications on virtual machines: how can they be managed in the same plane? Istio supports applications on virtual machines, so why do we need a management plane?\n\n## Management Plane\n\nTo manage gateways, traffic and security groupings, and apply them to different clusters and namespaces, you’ll need to add another layer of abstraction on top of Istio: a management plane. The diagram below shows the multitenant model of Tetrate Service Bridge (TSB). TSB uses Next Generation Access Control (NGAC) — a fine-grained authorization framework — to manage user access and also facilitate the construction of a zero-trust network.\n\n![Management Plane](008i3skNly1gsgg8ndcajj31il0u00z9.jpg)\n\nIstio provides workload identification, protected by strong mTLS encryption. This zero-trust model is better than trusting workloads based on topology information, such as source IP. A common control plane for multicluster management is built on top of Istio. Then a management plane is added to manage multiple clusters — providing multitenancy, management configuration, observability, and more.\n\nThe diagram below shows the architecture of Tetrate Service Bridge.\n\n![Tetrate Service Bridge](008i3skNly1gsgg951mknj314g0u0dnf.jpg)\n\n## Summary\n\nInteroperability of heterogeneous clusters is achieved with Kubernetes. Istio brings containerized and virtual machine loads into a single control plane, to unify traffic, security and observability within the clusters. However, as the number of clusters, network environments and user permissions become more complex, there is a need to build another management plane above Istio’s control plane (for example, [Tetrate Service Bridge](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/tetrate-service-bridge\/)) for hybrid cloud management.\n', '\/en\/blog\/multicluster-management-with-kubernetes-and-istio\/')">

This article will show you how to debug microservices in Kubernetes, introduce common tools, and explain how the introduction of Istio impacts debugging microservices.\n\n## Debugging microservices is vastly different from traditional monolithic applications\n\nThe debugging of microservices has been a long-standing problem for software developers. This challenge does not exist in traditional monolithic applications because developers can leverage the debugger in IDEs to add breakpoints, modify environment variables, single-step execution, etc. for their applications, all of which provide great help in software debugging. With the popularity of Kubernetes, the debugging of microservices becomes a thorny issue, where the following issues are more complicated than the debugging of traditional monolithic applications.\n\n### Multiple dependencies\n\nA microservice often depends on multiple other microservices, some shared volumes across multiple microservices, and authorizations based on service accounts. When debugging a microservice, how do you deploy other dependent services to quickly build a latest set of staging environments?\n\n### Access from a local machine\n\nWhen microservices are running on a developer’s local computer, there is usually no direct access to the services in a Kubernetes cluster. How can you debug microservices deployed in a Kubernetes cluster as if they were local services?\n\n### Slow development loop\n\nUsually, it takes a long process to update the code and build it into an image before pushing it to the cluster. How do you speed up the development cycle? Let’s look at the tools that address those challenges.\n\n## Tools\n\nThe main solutions for debugging microservices in Kubernetes are:\n\n- Proxy: by building a VPN, deploying a proxy in the Kubernetes cluster, and adding local debug endpoints to make the services in Kubernetes directly accessible to local applications, your architecture will look like [ local service ] \u003c-\u003e [ proxy ] \u003c-\u003e [ app in Kubernetes ].\n- Sidecar: Inject a sidecar into the pod of the microservice to be debugged to intercept all traffic to and from the service, so that the service can be tracked and monitored, and the service can also be debugged in this sidecar.\n- Service Mesh: To get an overall picture of the application, inject sidecars into all microservices so that you can get a dashboard that monitors global status.\n\nHere are three typical open source projects that implement the above solutions, each of which can help you debug microservices from a different perspective. You can apply them at different stages of software development and they can be said to be complementary to each other.\n\n### Proxy – debugging microservices with Telepresence\n\n[Telepresence](https:\/\/www.telepresence.io\/) is essentially a local proxy that proxies data volumes, environment variables, and networks in a Kubernetes cluster locally. The following diagram shows the main usage scenarios for Telepresence.\n\n![Proxy mode: Telepresence](telepresence.jpg)\n\nUsers need to manually execute the telepresence command locally, which will automatically deploy the agent to Kubernetes. Once the agent has been deployed,\n\n- Local services will have complete access to other services in the Kubernetes cluster, environment variables, Secret, ConfigMap, etc.\n- Services in the cluster also have direct access to the locally exposed endpoints.\n\nHowever, this approach requires users to run multiple commands while debugging locally, and in some network environments it may not be possible to establish a VPN connection to the Kubernetes cluster.\n\n### Sidecar – debugging microservices with Nocalhost\n\n[Nocalhost](https:\/\/nocalhost.dev\/) is a Kubernetes-based cloud development environment. To use it, you just need to install a plugin in your IDE – VS Code to extend Kubernetes and shorten the development feedback cycle. The development environment can be isolated by creating different namespaces for different users and using ServiceAccount when binding to different user corners. Nocalhost also provides a web console and API for administrators to manage different development environments.\n\n![Sidecar mode: Nocalhost](sidecar-nocalhost.jpg)\n\nAs long as you have a Kubernetes cluster and have admin rights to the cluster, you can refer to the Nocalhost documentation to quickly start trying it out. To use the Nocalhost plugin in VS Code, you need to configure the Kubernetes cluster in the plugin first.\n\n1. Select the Kubeconfig file you just exported or copy and paste the contents of the file directly into the configuration.\n2. Then select the service you need to test and select the corresponding Dev Container. VS Code will automatically open a new code window.\n\nHere is an example of the [bookinfo sample](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/docs\/examples\/bookinfo\/) provided by Istio. You can open the cloned code in your local IDE and click the hammer next to the code file to enter development mode. Selecting the corresponding DevContainer and Nocalhost will automatically inject a development container sidecar into the pod and automatically enter the container in the terminal, as shown in the following figure.\n\n![Nocalhost VS code](nocalhost-vs-code.jpg)\n\nIn development mode, the code is modified locally without rebuilding the image, and the remote development environment takes effect in real time, which can greatly accelerate the development speed. At the same time, Nocalhost also provides a server for managing the development environment and user rights, as shown in the following figure.\n\n![Nocalhost Web](nocalhost-web-admin.jpg)\n\n### Service Mesh – debugging microservices with Istio\n\nThe above method of using proxy and sidecar can only debug one service at a time. You’ll need a mesh to get the global status of the application, such as the metrics of the service obtained, and debug the performance of the service by understanding the dependency and invocation process of the service through distributed tracing. These observability features need to be implemented by injecting sidecar uniformly for all services. And, when your services are in the process of migrating from VMs to Kubernetes, using Istio can bring VMs and Kubernetes into a single network plane (as shown below), making it easy for developers to debug and do incremental migrations.\n\n![Service Mesh mode: Istio](istio-service-mesh.jpg)\n\nOf course, these benefits do not come without a “cost.” With the introduction of Istio, your Kubernetes services will need to adhere to the Istio naming convention and you’ll need to know how to debug microservices using the Istioctl command line and logging.\n\n- Use the *istioctl analyze* command to debug the deployment of microservices in your cluster, and you can use YAML files to examine the deployment of resources in a namespace or across your cluster.\n- Use *istioctl proxy-config secret* to ensure that the secret of a pod in a service mesh is loaded correctly and is valid.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn the process of microservicing applications and migrating from virtual machines to Kubernetes, developers need to make a lot of changes in their mindset and habits. By building a VPN between local and Kubernetes via proxy, developers can easily debug services in Kubernetes as if they were local services. By injecting a sidecar into the pod, you can achieve real-time debugging and speed up the development process. Finally, the Istio service mesh truly enables global observability, and you can also use tools like [Tetrate Service Bridge](https:\/\/www.tetrate.io\/tetrate-service-bridge\/) to manage heterogeneous platforms, helping you gradually move from monolithic applications to microservices.\n', '\/en\/blog\/how-to-debug-microservices-in-kubernetes-with-proxy-sidecar-or-service-mesh\/')">

Support for multiple Kubernetes clusters, with performance optimizations. |\n| March 3, 2020     | 1.5         | Back to monolith, with microservice components merged into istiod, making Istio’s architecture cleaner and easier to maintain. Support for WebAssembly extension, making Istio’s ecology much stronger. |\n| November 18, 2020 | 1.8         | Officially deprecated Mixer and focused on adding support for virtual machines. |\n\nA year after its inception– and two months before the 1.0 release, version 0.8 was released with a massive refactoring of the API. In late July 2018, when 1.0 was released, Istio reached a production-ready tipping point. Since then, Google has massively reorganized the Istio team and several Istio-based service mesh startups were born, making 2018 the booming year of the service mesh industry.\n\nIstio 1.1 was released in March 2019, almost 9 months after 1.0 was released, which is far beyond the average release cycle of an open-source project. We know that the speed of iteration and evolution is a core competency of basic software. Since then, Istio has started a regular [release cadence](https:\/\/istio.io\/v1.7\/about\/release-cadence\/) of one version per quarter and has become the [#4 fastest growing project in GitHub’s top 10 in 2019](https:\/\/octoverse.github.com\/#fastest-growing-oss-projects-by-contributors)!\n\n### The Istio community\n\nIn 2020, Istio’s project management began to mature and its governance reached a stage of evolution. We saw the first [election](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2020\/steering-election-results\/) of a steering committee for the Istio community and the transfer of the trademark to [Open Usage Commons](https:\/\/istio.io\/latest\/blog\/2020\/open-usage\/). The first [IstioCon](https:\/\/events.istio.io\/istiocon-2021\/) was successfully held in February 2021, with thousands of people attending the online conference. There is also a [large Istio community in China](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6m-rhyfy8sg\u0026list=PL7wB27eZmdffS-g_xh7X-b0echc_XZMKV\u0026index=8), and face-to-face Istio community meetups will be held there in 2021. Stay tuned for more.\n\n![](008i3skNly1gquicfqg14j31lw0smwl2.jpg)\n\nAccording to the CNCF 2020 Survey, 46% of organizations were either using a service mesh in production or planning to use it in the next 12 months. Istio was the top used mesh among those using a mesh in production.\n\n### The future\n\nAfter 4 years of development, there is not only a large user base around Istio, but also several Istio vendors, as you can see on the [homepage](https:\/\/istio.io\/) of the recently revamped Istio website. In the last few releases, Istio has shifted its development focus to improving the Day 2 Operation experience. We also expect to see more Istio adoption path recommendations, case studies, learning materials, training, and certifications (such as the industry’s first [Certified Istio Administrator](https:\/\/academy.tetrate.io\/courses\/certified-istio-administrator) from Tetrate) that will facilitate the adoption of Istio.\n', '\/en\/blog\/istio-4-year-birthday\/')">
